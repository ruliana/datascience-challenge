Rental car if you need to go to training or meetings saves the hammer on your own car. Cons If it wasn't for the reality that EE can cause you serious psychological trauma you would stand back and laugh at the weary, hopeless, dated management culture which exists particularly in the North East. Regional managers are given a rather pumped up view of themselves by the business but then have little to back it up other than so called motivation pulled from the internet as and when required. Be prepared to leave your moral compass at the door despite the facade that they are a reputable BT owned business, questionable selling is positively encouraged and transparency to the customer is ignored. Managers and staff are caught between two extremes, achieve the numbers and run the risk of the customer complaining which leads to serious consequences. Or, sell correctly to customer's needs and under perform which leads to serious consequences. They claim they have customer experience at the heart of what they do but basically want you to hard sell older customers who have been coming into top up their phones for years into taking out a sim only contract. You will be measured on the number of top ups done versus the payg to contract conversions. Simple answer: turn away the top ups. A very successful store in the NE is known for telling customers that they no longer sell top ups but only sell \"monthly direct debit credit for the customer's convenience\". Throw in the ridiculous focus on adding additional sales by selling poor quality tablets and then add the biggest driver of new connections in EE the mifi attachment. Customer walks in to upgrade paying say \u00a340 a month for a 5gb data contract on a phone. Data usage is about 3.5 Gb. Staff are urged to tell the customer they are going through more on their bill but then upgraded on their phone contract to a 300mb or 500mb data allowance but then sold a mifi unit as an additional line with 4gb of data for around \u00a310 per month. So for Region 3's convenience you now have to walk around with a yellow box in your pocket with 6 hours battery life rather than have the correct data usage on your phone. Network isn't what it's made out to be with 4g bandwidth quite obviously restricted and you customers frequently finding themselves shunted onto old 2g if making a call leading to call drop. Offers are poor value, EE rely on the under educated customer who think getting 250mb of data on a sim only for \u00a310.99 is a good deal. Regional commercial managers who are given the job of driving numbers have nothing in the way of coaching or people skills. They are only able to tell you if you have had a bad day when you know it, oh and then tell you to do better, which you also know. Staff have direct access the Regional Commercial Manager so it creates a culture where the store managers are short circuited. Successful customer advisors are treated way better than managers in struggling stores by the senior management. This completely undermines store manager integrity. Avoid for your sanity. Advice to Management Look closely at who you are employing as Regionals, focus on a collaborative leadership culture rather than current bullying culture.

Processes were never followed correctly - including sickness. Always had a note and a valid report of where I had been but was put through 3 disciplinary hearings and moved to stage 2. I did not appeal any of the decisions as a manager on a separate team had told me I'd never win so 'not to waste my time'. Was advised by a doctor not to MOVE let drive and walk around this was ignored by my manager and told if I go to stage 3 I will be fired immediately.. so I came in and they had made me go on the phones the next day (although I had been signed off for 3 weeks) This was not the correct process (remembering I had a lot of experience here) but it was my decision to leave without a fight than to be fired wrongly and appeal. Targets are unrealistic. Yes people hit them. But you'll never hear someone say 'i did great this month'. It's always 'well that was lucky..' as it's based on NPS it's totally out of your hands.
