Advice to Management Take a long hard look at the company that staff used to enjoy working at and listen to the feedback you receive and act on it to learn where you went wrong. Last feedback delivered to you was answered with basically \"I already know\" but as you haven't done anything about it it shows the staff that you know but you don't care, as long as you have the money rolling in and all bonuses are only paid to director level or above. Any request to reward staff is declined due to financial reasons but money is thrown at people as soon as you realise you have driven the most experienced staff out of the door. If the money was availale to recognise talent in the first place they wouldn't walk. The little perks and office environment, as well as communication and recognition for both hard work and service used to make it a company people wanted to work for and to recommend to friends and family. It is no longer a company anyone wants to work at, nevermind recommend to others. Review the sick leave and the reason why people are off sick and respect and reward the staff who have been loyal and hardworking . Recognise their achievements rather than using it as a weapon against them. Managers are there to monitor and review the performance of their staff but it seems their performance is not reviewed and they are left to their own devices with no action taken if they do not meet or even skim the requirements of their performance targets or basic job role and responsibilities. It's such a shame things had to get this far. Seeing over 100 years experience walk out of the door within a 2 week period should make you sit up and wonder why, unfortunately it hasn't and the years of experience leaving the business just continues to add up.", "rating": 1, "pros": "Flexible working", "cons": "Bully tactics", "advice": "Take a long hard look at the company that staff used to enjoy working at and listen to the feedback you receive and act on it to learn where you went wrong.", "predicted": "collaboration"}, {"title": "Average - could do so much more", "text": "Pros Have to push hard to progress and develop.

CVs received expecting more were binned and often the roles were offered to internal staff with little to no experience and little to no training support given on the job. Management - Well where to start, lets just say that there were some very \"close\" direct line managers, where staff couldn't raise any issues. Process and policy changes including systems that didn't match the companies policies were signed off and used in little silos by \"close\" managers. You would think senior managers would remove issues like this through reallocation of personnel, you know professional approach and all that. HR - Very poor and often HR issues were shared and emails to management via the \"Ask\" system were put through a lower inexperienced manager/secretary level of staff to reply. This caused a very poor atmosphere in the office. People told the contracts weren't being renewed by pointing at them walking around the team saying no, yes no, yes. - Unfortunately this really happened. Pay/Salary - the guys working here do so for peanuts with the level of work that they complete. 12 minutes personal breaks allowed in a day and you are timed, we aren't at school and if they actually managed staff better they wouldn't need this type of poor management styles...

Some of those businesses are forced to adopt the Logo some manage to avoid the honour. These 100 businesses are all controlled by layers and layers of bureaucracy, with individual business Units, Towers and Divisions, all with management structures and governance rules and regulations which make it very hard to get things done. They are aware of the fact that they are one of the most promising businesses in the country if they could just get their act together but they just cant seem to work it out. What tends to happen is that management layers will change on a regular basis due to the fact that profits aren\u2019t going up fast enough. The management layers then have political battles or \u2018land grabs\u2019 to increase their Empires / chances of success by pulling in profitable business units which creates constant restructures and redundancies. Due to the fact the management layers are constantly changing the restructures never stop, which means that people are constantly at risk. You are most at risk in December, just in time to ruin your Xmas or June, to spoil the summer holidays, which means that people approach the holidays with serious trepidation. People who are good at their jobs generally leave after the 1st or 2nd round of redundancies, which normally happens around 12 months after an initial acquisition. People who come in and are good at their jobs can quickly get overwhelmed with work because people with high levels of motivation are in short supply 'for obvious reasons'. If you are extremely motivated and driven Capita could be the perfect fit for you to develop your skills and climb the ladder as they recognise and promote talent, the issue is the environment created by everything else that\u2019s going on around you and how long you can cope with it. Not all business units within Capita are like this, I have been told that some are good places to work and some people who left while I was there did come back but to other roles. If you are a truly talented sales person Capita will look after you very well and pay you well, but the support you will get from others in the business \u2018for obvious reasons\u2019 will make it very challenging to succeed.
