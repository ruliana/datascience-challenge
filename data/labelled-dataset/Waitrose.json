I made endless calls the day before with no luck only to talk to a line manager who did not care and said \"I dont know, come in at 10am alright bye\". This was supposedly my line manager. After calling the whole day that was my answer. Upon arrival of my first day I was brought up to a room and sat at a computer where I had to do my training online. I was left for 6 hours by myself to do this where nobody came back for me or to check on me. There was a lot of difficult stuff to get through with some things I did not understand and nobody around to ask. I was not given training face to face, shown around the building/staff area. I was not given a uniform or shown where to come in the following morning as it was a 7am start before the store even opened.
