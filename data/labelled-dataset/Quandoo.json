Even if those employees do not possess the required skills to lead a team or project. Commission structure is also designed in a way that pit employees against each other, creating an every man for himself culture. Extreme micro managing as HQ always think they know best. Any failure to hit targets will always result in management threatening to fire you, if you can't handle that the job is not for you. The pressure to perform is constant and they only celebrate numbers. No consideration is given on whether the customer is a good fit for the service/product. as Long as targets are hit at the end of the month, you're considered a superstar even if the account churns in 3 months or never pays up. Customer success is not part of the values as they only want to get the signature on the contract and as much revenue as possible. Account managers do not have any valuable recommendations to give on how to use the platform. It is not their fault as the platform just doesn't work and no resource is being allocated to keep abreast of best industry practices, upcoming trends etc.. Product development is slow and the software is very buggy. Instead of trying to be ahead of the curve by inventing innovative features, the Dev pipeline is constantly behind competitors. There are features recently developed that competition has had for years! They hardly listen to client facing employees feedback about the product and always claim nothing is wrong or if a feature is suggested that our competition has, the Dev team has to be convinced that it's worth working on. The company has absolutely no idea how to market the platform and their accounts even with a huge Budget. Everything done up until acquisition was for investors and funding rounds, therefore there was no proper Long term plan on consumer market penetration or product development life cycle. Many customers are complaining they do not see the value brought by the platform as they see no results.

Be prepared to spend 20 min on a task that should take you 30 secs - Unless you're high up in the hierarchy: no support from HQ. There's a review here that says exactly the opposite. I'm guessing this person is a country manager or something... - Silo mentality. Some teams (usually the ones not in direct contact with customers-accounts) won't lift the little finger if you don't hand it to them on a plate The ugly: - NO WORK LIFE BALANCE.

You'll still do your admin work during business hours. You'll basically work two jobs. You'll be paid for one. You'll never see your friends, family or partner. Your health will take a hit - Poor pay. Obviously what seems OK on the basis of 38 hours/ week, give or take the occasional crazy month, seems pretty poor when you work 70 hour-weeks on the regular, all year round - I've seen 2 people getting fired simply because they didn't bring in the same results after a while. A little like when you kill a horse that helped on the farm all its life but is now getting too old... No, all those reviewers on pages 2 and 3 saying they are afraid to lose their job month after month are not too dramatic - If you're good and achieve 100% of your targets, next month management will expect 120% from you - But you may be good one month because the targets appeal to your strengths. The company changes focus every month. So drop everything you were doing last month. Your new targets may not appeal to your strengths anymore. You may fall short, at say 60-80%. In which case, be prepared to have one-on-ones with management (not of the pleasant kind) - Obviously turnover is crazy. Just have a look at the number of past employees on Linkedin.
