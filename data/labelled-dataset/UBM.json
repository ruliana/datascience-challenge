Yes, men and women like Tim Cobbold make pragmatic decisions to generate profit, but their demeanour embodies and validates the company's stated principles. - Compensation and benefits that, while not leading-edge, can compete with the \"whole package\" included. Cons This pertains to Life Sciences Group, a division of UBM Americas, only. Purchased in late 2014, media and tradeshow company Advanstar Communications was positioned for integration in 2015, the assumption being, like all other UBM acquisitions, its human capital and intellectual properties would be utilised with the advantages of UBM conduct and culture. The opposite occurred. Advanstar is a business that did not in fact recover from the '08 downturn. Instead, it glided on the momentum of lucky performers less the drag of overhead for proper staffing; indeed, one of its selling points was \"productivity,\" whereas it was crucially understaffed and underprovisioned. From this came Advanstar's own corporate culture, which met UBM's culture, chiefly UBM Medica's, and ate it for breakfast. Top down, it is ruled by perceptions of fear and scarcity, in which empowered survivor types have carved out domains operating in a fashion that is essentially feudal. In practical terms this translates to: - No transparency or strategy from the top, following a tradition of unaccountable, untouchable executive leadership. - Current executives practised in the art of self-preservation; tacticians not strategists who claim credit and sidestep failure. - Inaction stemming from fear of reprisal or, more often, direct micromanagement or marginalisation from levels as high as EVP. - Cronyism owing to power-driven relationships, littering offices with bizarre cases of loafers, incompetents and saboteurs. - Poor or zero communication between organisationally or even literally adjacent teams, causing duplication or neglect of business. - As catchall, suppression of UBM culture, including UBM's five pillars of excellence and methods for success. Advice to Management Remove Life Sciences Group executive leadership now. Whatever you eat from abrogation will be dwarfed by the smoking crater of finances, capital, talent and reputation left within 12-14 months. Assign someone suitably objective and steel-nerved such as the current COO of Americas to serve in interim, with their selection of 2-3 specialised aides, while you search for replacements. What this transitional team uncovers will shock them, and shock you, as you realise how valuable resources have been squandered or outright misused, tech/market onramps missed, and good talent abused or driven out of UBM entirely.

It's not warm and the people I worked with were cliquey, toxic, and rude. It's just not a positive environment, especially for people of color. I did not like working here at ALL. Once my manager changed, it got progressively worst since that particular manager had never managed before and was passive aggressive, insecure and on a weird power-trip. Upper management and HR were aware of his antics and did nothing. Instead of being objective and neutral, HR usually sides with the manager (in the wrong) when there is a complaint, making them utterly useless. Two other employees told me of instances where they felt their managers were abusing their power and treating them horribly yet it resulted in very little action or resolve from HR. Employees have also mentioned to me that they felt they had to watch their backs and couldn't trust anyone there.

There is no room for creative thinking or career growth here, so say goodbye to any marketing skills you had because it's all about how fast you can get something out the door. Every project is dissected and outsourced to centralized teams where it takes three times as long to get anything done. Systems are also outdated and not compatible with new technology so be prepared to do a lot of manual work and expect lots of roadblocks when trying to accomplish what seems like an easy task. There is an unrealistic expectation to juggle the workload of 3 people's jobs, while attending 8-12 hours of meetings per week, keeping internal and external relationships satisfied all at the same time. And when you don't meet this expectation, you will be blamed for everything. Management does not support you or what you do, and takes no responsibility for their severe lack of industry knowledge and inability to properly manage the team. You can try to explain the challenges you are facing, but no one will ever listen. To make matters worse, when members of your team frequently get laid off or leave the company, they do not replace them. You will be expected to pick up the slack and keep on performing at an efficient level. The salary is well below average, and it's nowhere near close enough to compensating you for what you will have to put up with. The open office environment is equally disappointing with a terrible layout, distracting noise level, and a lack of adequate conference rooms - leading to meetings in the break room where people are no longer able to have breaks. Overall morale is terrible, there is frequent turnover and most people are unhappy in their jobs. Advice to Management Listen to your employees when we tell you something is wrong.
