If you're a technophile, or a gadget nut, you'll be surrounded by like-minded individuals. Cons Promotion prospects can vary pretty wildly depending on which part of the business you do the bulk of your work in, with some teams seeing frequent promotions and others not so much. Politics can creep into this aspect as well, with some people getting bad reputations because someone higher up doesn't like them as much as others. There has been a history of promoting the people who say the right things, rather than the ones who necessarily do the best job, but that seems to be getting better. Historically, I haven't always felt that I got useful feedback in terms of areas to address in order to progress. Unsure as to whether that's because there was no feedback to give (and I was being kept back for some political reason) or whether they were unsure how to resolve the issues. Again, this has improved over time. The office does have a bit of politicking, but I imagine that's pretty common and that Gamesys isn't atypical. Advice to Management Keep communications open - Nobody wants to be bothered by everyone from every team about every little thing all the time, but at the same time just having one point of contact within a team means that you don't always get a clear understanding of more than one point of view. Keep promoting people who want to make changes for the better, and not just those who tell you what you want to hear!

You are expendable, they will take on 2 of you for 1 position - you are just back up. Having a quiet disposition is a valid reason for firing someone here, regardless if you're good at your job. An incompetent line manger with poor communication skills, double standards, picks on you for no reason and gives you conflicting advice. No team brainstorming on the team I was on. Many employees with a \"don't care\" attitude. Won't help out fellow workers by keeping kitchen or toilet facilities clean - place can look like a dump. One even vomited in the office after a night out lol. Never given the opportunity to show off your full set of skills, then accused of not doing anything amazing. Your bosses gossip about you having to leave behind your back, (literally). Instead of communicating anything to you so you can do better. Made to feel like you committed a crime on your team and ostracised. You can't even come in a day after you lost your job to take home some work for your cv as they are that efficient at erasing you. Unthanked for the work I had provided during my time there no warm goodbye. Just \"you shouldn't even be here\" when I went to pick up my stuff - appalling Advice to Management Make sure one of your design line managers can actually do their job and have good communication skills. They shouldn't pick on employees for no reason, showing a disregard for some peoples work and favouritism for others, even though many people find the general work on the team to be satisfactory. Find the time to look into the full skill set new employees have before you make a decision. Because you are overlooking people with a wide range of beneficial skills for the company. You will find the quiet people are the real ones doing any work, don't get rid of these people. My advice for other designers looking to work here. Approach with extreme caution. Your are expendable in their eyes they don't care if you have previous experience (I had 5 years at a similar place) a good cv or other cool skills that can be put to use.

At Gamesys we do own tech, so it's a good place to get involved and learn about all the intricacies of a complex system - backend servers and software, social networks, frontend graphics, etc. If you are passionate yourself, about learning and improving, you'll probably go far here (but see notes below for warnings) and it's an ideal place if you're just starting out (e.g. graduate). There are opportunities to work in a number of different disciplines and change teams. The technology whilst not really being mindblowing will give you a solid CV. The staff are by and large friendly. There is a good social atmosphere (if you like that sort of thing), with regular ad hoc pub visits in their local which they practically own these days, and internal drinks / disco etc. if people don't like going to pubs, where everyone can socialise within the building. There are team building events, and company building events... and the CEO does a great job at fostering a togetherness and a drive. There are wide and varied languages in use, so you'll get exposure to a lot - check the website for their current techstack, but they're essentially hot on javascript lua and java - you probably wont get to use anything else unless you're in a specialist team, but as mentioned transfer is fairly easy and common. There is a good sense of comradery within teams. Cons Agile: Gamesys is one of those semi-agile places, where everyone strives for the concepts, but never fully achieves them, because (unlike the grassroots techies here) the business fundamentally doesn't understand agile. To their credit they've given it a go, but they don't get how they'd need to change business processes to accomodate it. There's been rebranding of PMs as Scrummasters, PMOs be established, people constantly shifting in (and out) of management roles, as the business try to get a handle on what works. It's been more stable recently however, so maybe they've figured they've done it. So expect iterations/sprints here, but dont expect to release every day, or even every iteration. Expect standups, but dont expect the business to attend them. Expect short items of work for tech, but arbitrary deadlines from marketing which actually dont matter that much, but they must be met. Expect the team to require knowledge from the business on how/what to do something, but expect there to be \"buffer\" people whose responsibility it is to find that information out for the team, rather than being directly connected to them. Expect burndown charts, and teams which can self-monitor and self-improve but expect to log all your time in a company monitoring system too so upper management can feel like they know whats going on. Expect retrospectives and regular feedback within the team, but expect to be rewarded at the end of the year in a completely arbitrary way by a board of people you've never met making a judgment about you. There is no pan-company joined up workflow. Startup vs Enterprise: If you've got some great ideas yourself about using this or that framework, dont expect a speedy transition even if you're \"correct\" - in fairness they've been burnt a lot of times by new tech going wrong, or not having the right levels of knowledge to run it, and are wary of new tech and new ideas, but it is possible to progress at a snails pace. For example, they've only just adoped git over svn which is a nobrainer, but has taken them to now to do it. The slowness is probably by design- helping with their stability as a platform which must not go wrong at all costs, and the fact they have hundreds upon hundreds of members of staff, and so quickly steering all those staff is nigh on impossible... but if you're someone keen to implement something you know which has a great benefit , your overriding feeling with be one of frustration and you have to be patient to the tune of years. The best I've seen is you may get lucky and might get asked to prove your idea and the benefits... they aren't averse to good ideas. Gamesys love spending money on enterprise products when they have some great talent who could easily engineer their own solutions with open source tools available. Upper management at Gamesys suffer from that classic chronic ailment that they believe if they double the number of staff they'll get double the amount of work. For their platform you'll be staggered at how many devs and operations staff there are. Ultimately my advice is, if you're a passionate tech: come here and spend a couple of years to pick up all the skills you need and then shift off to a place where you can really drive something... if you're a coaster tech: come here and just stick around. Ultimately it's a good place, worth a punt, but I'd wager you after 2 years you'll be frustrated. Which in the tech industry isn't that bad!

The company is made up of a core group of people, unless they like you, you will get abused and bullied. If they don't like you, you will be forced out pretty soon, no matter how talented you are. I would also like to point out that all the bad reviews have a lot of similarities, so they can't be written by odd disgruntled employees (as someone wrote in a review)..like reviews of restaurants or hotels, the bad reviews are 99% of the times the real ones. All the good reviews are just too good to be true and they look fishy to me....as if they were written by someone inside that infamous core group of people..

[The HR personnel themselves are however exceptional.] You will be asked to provide names of ex-colleagues for head-hunters. 4) The Dev services team is heavily loaded, i.e. gaining access to PC/MAC support can be delayed. 5) Please keep in mind that Gamesys monitor the job search engines for when you do decide to put your CV up as part of your transition to a new role - you may thus experience a sudden increase in work-load when they detect it.

The projects and workload, while exciting and appealing, can be very demanding and a lot of the teams are expected to drop their personal lives at a moment's notice, to work late or work weekends which is unacceptable for no thanks. One of the biggest issues was the \"drive-by\" mentality from senior managers in the late stages of a game development process which resulted in the fact that the project was thrown for 6. This meant longer hours to change fundamental parts of a game that frankly, didn't need to be changed. Agile methods were executed differently by each team and a lot of dependencies from cross-team requirements meant that often a game or launch was impeded. One of the most crazy things I saw was Marketing not bothering to talk to Studio. They'd book expensive TV slots and not align to any of the sprints for delivery, often not telling anyone in the teams when a new game or service was needed and not really allowing for the work to be done - resulting again, in stressed teams running around to fix the problem. If you want to work for a company that pushes you hard, expects you to sweat blood and tears and fails to even thank you at the end of it (apart from a 360 process that doesn't use any objectives properly) - then this organisation is for you.

Cons This company it is not what it seems, the recruiters, managers and technical people try to sell you something that doesn't exist.

The architecture is monolithic and the projects are old and a big mess and the releases last forever. There are a couple of new projects, but beware you won't work on them. The company plays favourites all the time and if you are a new starter you would be assigned to one of the old projects and then pray to be reassigned - unlikely to happen. Team wise, it's quite average and playing politics all the time, so be careful what you say and do. Some are friendly, but they are just playing you. Then depends on the team, if you are under a certain TA you are assured to have a hard time. In my time there so many people left that team because of his ways, but managers choose to do nothing - apparently he is one of the favourites. I was lucky in that sense, the TA was a bit better. But still, everything was \"do this\" and \"with these tools\" and that's all the help and freedom you'd get. There is no freedom to select any technology out of the stack, except for a few individuals and then they can sell that to management - for instance Neo4j. Career wise, well, nothing unless you are one of the favourites. The reviews are based on your popularity, visibility and on the project you are working on.
