But as soon as the date of joining approached and I got in touch with them, they started delaying the date. They kept telling me that I would receive an official mail and call from them the next day. And this \"next day\" happened for over a week. Later, I get a call from them stating that the project was scrapped. *They made me quit my previous job assuring me that Genpact process was final- the resignation was necessary so as to make sure I do not indulge in dual employment. *They didn't let me finish the Notice period at my previous workplace as the process at Genpact was solely waiting on my joining to initiate. So I had to pay from my pocket for not finishing up the notice. *They did not start with their induction and training as on the date that they had stated. Thus, making me lose my pay from any workplaces for those days. *And finally, they very simply stated that the project was scrapped and would take me for some customer care department in a different location (which is 2 hours from my place, one way) and at an odd hour shift. As per them, they were doing ,me a favour by not making me re-interview for the new customer care process, which from what I have understood required less skill set. And considering the new job location is not easily commutable distance from my place and that too at odd work hours (3 AM) for a profile I did not sign up for, I seriously fail to see the good that they are offering there. And what's more? Ever since that, they have stopped communicating with me. They do not revert to my mails, messages, phone calls... nothing. They very conveniently put me in a soup and have disappeared. I fail to understand how did they come to be such a big brand if this is the way their HR team functions, the management runs. Or is it all just a facade! I would never want to work with such an organization and recommend nobody to take it up either. What happened with me was at the beginning, yours could be after you join or while leaving. You never know! You can never tell! Not with the kind of things that this organization is capable of pulling off. Advice to Management The organization needs to be more transparent and communicate internally as well. I cannot comprehend how the organization that was so keen to make me join them in a week for the process suddenly decided to strike down the project completely. And moreover, stop playing with people's job and their careers. You can very conveniently say a 'sorry' for messing things up, but they still have to fend for themselves and their families and their lives. And if things get faulty at your part, have the decency to provide a solution and not completely go off the radar.

Let me try capturing all (but I am sure I would have missed a few) - 1. Poor Management Team - Management is utterly disorganized. No clue about the business and almost no idea how to deal with people. I have worked both in London and Bangalore and found the situation to be no different 2. Farcical HR institution - The HR institution is merely an extension of the management, clad in the robe of a HR team. They do not provide any answers and in the event of a dispute with management, be assured you will receive no support from the HR. As an example, I had to survive for a few months without pay for no fault of mine and the HR and management did absolutely nothing. 3. Laggard processes - For an organisation claiming black belt expertise, no process is streamlined. Getting something as simple as expenses claimed can take between 30-90 days! Note that expenses get deducted from salary at the end of 90 days. The process of claims from salary is faster than process of expenses being cleared! 4. Lack of interesting opportunities - I was lucky to get one of the few interesting opportunities we had, allowing me to travel, however, majority of the people I've worked with left in frustration. The attrition was as high as 40% because of a lack of career growth. This is clearly a poor reflection on the organisation. 5. Salary structure - Be aware, what you are promised is not what you will get. The structure is in such a manner that you will likely only make 60-70% of what you believed you would get in hand. 6. Benefits - There are absolutely no benefits. Most other organisations offer benefits like cabs, gym discounts, bike rental discounts etc, however, there are no such benefits here. 7. Bonus and Increment - Bonus and increment are laughable. In a year where the company made handsome profits and being rated top performed, I got less than 10% salary hike and less increment than contractually agreed. This was because the division performed poorly (which is a result of poor management than poor work of the employees), clearly the bonus and increment structure is flawed. Advice to Management Please shut down this god awful company and do us all a favor.

I though do my ears deceive me, you are demotivating a staff who is working night shift just because you feel that will demotivate someone working day shift.

You have to wait at least 18 months and you cannot apply outside your department. So wait for another long period after completing the minimum waiting period. You think you are a hard worker, don't even think of joining Genpact. They will push you to the edge and then push you further.

Cons For some reason, most of the discussion focussed on the anonymity aspect. The invite to the suvey said it would be anonymous, the survey was hosted on an external site and we don't use any intranet, the handful invites I checked all pointed to the same URL. That's what I meant with \"I think the survey is actually anonymous\" - I saw no straightforward way to de-anonymize the results down to the level of a person. We received the invite to the survey with very little time till deadline, I think most of the answers and discussion happened after. That's why I didn't adjust the question, since it wouldnt be useful to my specific situation anyway but would disrupt the lively discussion happening. What I did: I was pretty honest and mentioned negative points, about the same as I told my boss in our last one-on-one. My boss asked me (to late) to be positive: The company was in a difficult situation, he feared that negative voices on the survey would give upper management the idea that all is hopeless and they should cut further losses. This is a small (100 people) company distributed on four continents, nobody knows what's actually going on. When asking this question I was thinking about these political ramifications (but wasn't posting enough info on the company maybe) & and wha upper management likely does with the survey data. In the team with my boss, we were also discussing the actual anonymity and how things like timezones, speech idiosyncracies (English is a second language to all of us in this office) etc. might give upper management a clear idea who wrote what. I left the company a few months later, till then I had not heard back from the survey.

The reason being the team structures are not too rigid. One can work on a particular thing in a larger team and also can get opportunity to work on other facets of work which the larger team does, if the person is interested. Another reason this aspect of career improvement gets facilitated is because generally people can take an hour or two from their regular work day and learn and discuss stuff from other team members 6) You can give honest feedback to HR, senior management about your reporting manager if things are unfair. Obviously, things may get leaked and people may not like it. But you would not be penalized if your case is genuine. I have come across some instances where such things happened and feedback was given to the manager. The manager would have been pissed off but made serious efforts to improve. All this reflects very well on the cultural maturity of this organization.

Wide business & verticals: Genpact is full of opportunities for every minimum qualification. Learn work & move through IJP to different departments & verticals like BFSI, BFS, CPGA & many more. Job security: As Genpact is full of outsourcing business, you don't have to worry about loosing it in future. opportunities are always there. Promotions: Very easy if you don't get involved with negative people. Complete your trainings, be regular, keep good ratings, be motivated. Off the job trainings: if you wish to learn & get exposed directly with clients, Genpact is the right Co.

They don't even keep disposable glass for drinking water, no stationery. Lol Poor transport: In Gurgaon branches, cabs are usually late. But Noida is better. Poor management: You can find Assistant managers & Sr. Mgrs everywhere in Genpact, AVPs are common. & none of them can motivate you about career. Most Managers are self centred. They treat Band 5A population like slaves. Band 4 enjoys the team fund & do parties & misuse corporate cards. If you complaint they will ask you to have IJP, spoil your ratings, senior will irritate you everyday, give you unnessary work. Work load: Band 5 population is usually pissed off in department where quantative work is done. Night shift sucks & late cabs will make worst. No work & life balance. Mgrs will ask you to do work instead of enrolled training. Associates working in grave yard shift cannot attend training in day shift, impossible ! Managers are deaf they don't understand. No growth in BFSI, only CPGA is growing. You will become process developer in CPGA withing 18 months. But may take 3 yrs in BFSI or more.

Anyone not comfortable, ignore the review and read an other one. The Company is a pioneer BPO, Beware and dont be carried away, The Standard has been a steady decline, it had hit its bottom. Less work pressure, Well, the Pros could have been a lenghthy list, Say Training, employee welfare, however, one couldnt say all those. work stations are ergonomic - Thanks to GE (who build the uppal facility) All processes are easy and can be negotiated with in your 9 hours shift. Lots of dayshft processes - so worth giving a shot. Promotions - Similar to all the companies - politics and favoratism does exists Learning and educational cource offered @ genpact - Well honestly all the companies provide them, nothing significant. I Gotta rate them 2 Star rating instead of 1- as their business model still works with a below par pay structure (Gotta give it to the higher management for the strategies which they had come up with) - it works. Cons Training - almost Nil (Cost involved) Compensation - Way below industry standard Cab facility - Smartly designed (got to give it) coz it discorages employees to use cabs Ambience and comfort in office - A/C wouldnt work most time. (Lobbies it does work, not on the floor) Pray everyday a client visists (As A/C would work when Clients are around as they are humans and we are ?) Most of Middle management - are now below par compared to 5 years earlier ( why, they all moved to other companies) and hence a very mediocre standard and knowledge. \"You get what you pay for\" Team outings and other activities where cost is involved - Forget it Few companies would recruit you one level below Genpact Designation (be aware) The design of GE - GECIS and DNA of 6 Sigma has disappeared. Ask any one who joined post 2006, they would be oblivious to this. One of the cornerstones of Genpact \"Integrity\" is very questionable when comes to information transfer between Management and Customers.( This is sensitive and leagal - Cant explain ) Every silly operation procedure would take a Ticket, followed by 1 st level escalation, then a 2nd escalation. Nothing works as a profesional environment. If you are in middle managment - watchout.( it becomes annoying beyond a point ) ( In a while you get used to it, however, its a skill which you woulnd need elsewhere) HR is redefined - designation counts in everything. It used to be a forem where you can voice out and action was taken. now dont even dream. if you are an associate escalating a AM, AM wins. if you are an AM escalating about an M, then M wins. (AM- Assistant Manager, M - Manager) HYD- they have a new facility in pocharam, now thats a bit far for most folks, so watch out where you would be placed. (Its a highway and rediculous traffic - Few fatalities reported) - best advise is use the company bus from uppal. Get water bottles to office, apparently cups are very expensive to provide (this is where it reaches the heights of cost cutting) - or those who have been to US, know in US offices they dont have cups either, but a water dispenser from which you can direclty drink. That equipments costs. and hence .... you know what am going to say. New applicants - be patient with HR (They are under a tremendrous stress) coz they had to recruit almost 365 days. they come across to u very rude most times and pretty unprofessional. coz the attrition is really healthy. Cant really blame the First line HR. Pity. Finally - Before taking a carrier decision please talk to an employee who is atlest 4 years in the organisation and a close friend. Those who read reviews, please take a min and give your inputs aswell. It really does help.

Good for growth if you want to a low earning manager or AVP. Cons Lowest pay if you started out here or have been here too long.If you are joining with experience you need to bargain hard. There is no fixed salary structure and you may get your desired remuneration if the process is desperate to fill positions.Be rest assured that the folks who interview you would have no clue about the technology they talk about.Once you are in, any future hike is a mirage and is only based on the time spent and closeness to you manager and not on capabilities. Company promotes you instead of giving hikes.They take pride in the fact that they promote 1 employee a day on an average.There are too many managers and AVPs with low pay scales due to this policy. Company promotes BPO managers and appoints them in Technology processes screwing up any leadership and technology mentoring scope for the team members.The BPO managers call themselves techies based on the fact that they worked in a Outlook or desktop help desk which is considered very techie by BPO standards.You will crave for technology work but will find managers and AVPs in abundance. You will feel misplaced the moment you step in if you are a technology guy since the atmosphere is pure call center like or a B grade college canteen with youngsters (mostly call center folks) running around shouting and screaming. HR policies are mostly BPO centric which means no night shift , weekend or on call allowances. Company does not use basic IT components such as pager alerting for Technology folks who do on call and you need to be in front of your system (especially on weekend nights ) all the time looking for alerts. There is no attendance system in place and you are totally at the mercy of your manager to prove that you were indeed at work on a particular day.If you are close to your manager , you don't need to apply for any leaves taken at all in the leave tracking system. The managers don't have clue about technology since they were former BPO employees and provide no buffer between the client and the engineers.I had joined with an outside experience of around 5 years in a newly formed team and was surprised to find the manager's salary was less than most of the engineers in the team due to skewed HR remuneration policies. A team of 10 will have no less than 4 managers since the company wants to fit it the newly managers created by their \"more promotion and less hike\" policies.This may work out for the BPO folks well since you can find many 21 year old managers too in the company.This is due to the fact that they tie up with local Universities and hire folks from first year graduation on a 3 day work 3 day college program.This works out as cheap hiring and saves company costs. Employees are eligible for on site opportunities after 18 months of joining at a peanut remuneration of $30-40 a day since most of the call center crowd are dreamy eyed about the US. Six Sigma and Lean are some of the buzz words here used by folks to show off their non-existent capabilities. Work is mostly night shifts (without allowances) due to the US based clients so beware if you have a wife and kids at home.Your social life would go in for a full toss.If you happen to work day ( in case you are very lucky to get such a team ) you will find a deserted look in office since most of the teams work nights. On boarding is a nightmare and you be herded like cattle since the company has walk in practically every week for it BPO operations due to the high attrition rate. Tech folks aren't treated any different from BPO freshers.
