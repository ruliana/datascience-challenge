Oh, and when you leave work, you weren't really expected to answer e-mails. They used to have good people and good middle management. Used to. Cons The reason they *used* to have good people and good middle management is because they forced them out in a bizarre power struggle originating at the top after the private equity firm bought the company. Now instead of a poorly-paying article mill (virtually every story is just plugging in quotes or facts into a standard format, obtained by cold calling companies) with good people you can hang out with on the day-to-day, it's a poorly-paying article mill filled with gossip, paranoia, suspicion, and condescension. In my last year of working there, we had a company-wide meeting to discuss the acquisition by the private equity firm. Initially there was hope that the PE firm would help the employees out, so a brave colleague of mine asked if there would be a market check for employee salaries. The CEO replied that there had been a market check already, at which everyone literally burst out laughing. That's right \u2013 it's the kind of company that likes to urinate on your head and tell you it's raining. The company has had immense turnover in the past year and a half (approaching 40%), which I suppose is good for the junior people as the only way promotions were (rarely) handed out was because the person above you quit or died. No merit rewards here, kids. The only senior people left are desperately looking for a way out, while the junior people are asking the senior people why no one told them it would be that bad. Which is sad, because it used to be a great place to get a serious start in financial journalism. Sure, the pay was crap, but no one else was willing to take a chance on you. Little did you know, upon starting out, that the pay was crap and would remain crap. Until the day I quit, at which point they jumped to offer me a raise, despite me begging for one repeatedly and consistently being turned down while I was there. But by then, of course, it was way too little, way too late. Oh, and the website looks like it's from 1997. They've been \"planning to upgrade it\" every year, but they're still convinced \"everyone reads the site on their Blackberries.\" As if you still know anyone who has a Blackberry.

Cons I will try and go through all departments and give you an insight regarding the working environment, type of work, Salary (true value) and management. Wealthmonitor \u201cwm\u201d. Your yearly starting salary at wm will be 19K, there is no negotiations (Although I must say they might have increased in to 20K starting, not sure, but thought it\u2026). They haven\u2019t changed this starting salary since the company was founded, so you can imagine the kind of attitude this company has regarding salary. Your salary will then increase to 20K once you pass your probation, always expect a 500-1000 pound yearly increase otherwise you will become very disappointed. However, if you work very hardf putting in more hours and actually add real value, then and only then could you expect 1000-1500 pound increase. Yearly bonus could be 1K-2K. The actual work you do is basic research and basic data entry, without any exaggeration you will become a vegetable if you do this job for to long. They basically want you to go through open sources and find a specific persons telephone number, address, interests and family members. You then also calculate how much the person will get if they sell of their stake in the company. It\u2019s a very unscientific calculation based on the companies revenue, this is not analysis you will take the companies revenue and then based on a industry multiple calculate the value, A*B. This is basically the kind of job that you will start hating after 3-6 months, there is literally no career progression within the team, no ad hoc work that you can do on the side, and no training. The work I described is what you will be doing, everyday\u2026. \u201cIMPORTANT\u201d, this department within mergermarket is most likely going to be outsourced very soon, they have stopped hiring when people leave and only hire for languages that the outsourcing company can\u2019t deal with. Mergermarket (mergermarket product), has two positions which they hire for, the Research Analysts but then also the Deal Researcher, I will try and go over each subject for both. Analyst: Your yearly starting salary will be 21K and then increase to 22K when you pass your probation. Or you will just start on 22K, it all depends on the day and the mood of the manager, there is no real policy just as long as its not above 22K. There is no negotiations here you accept or decline its that simple. You can expect a 1K yearly increase as standard, could be less. In this department, if you work your long hours and and actually add value you expect a 2K increase. It is very rarely that you will get a increase over 2k, more or less never happens. Yearly bonus could be 2K-4K. Managers has made policy of lying to their employees regarding salary to try and keep individuals motivated, promising higher increases next year but always fail to deliver. Deal Researcher: Your starting salary will be 20K (they might have increased it to 21K). Same here no negotiations. Yearly increase will be \u00a3500 pounds to 1K. If you work very hard and actually add value, well then its still the same amount. Yearly bonus could be 500 punds-1K. For the Research Analyst position, your role will involve going through M&A transactions and copy paste relevant information from press releases. If there is a deal value you will add it if not, there will be no analysis to try and evaluate the company. In terms of financials you will look at the companies annual report and copy paste their revenue, EBIT, EBITDA and profit. And then for companies that provide a deal value calculate their net debt. Very simple work. On a quarterly basis you will also work on mergermarkets press releases, you will not write anything just add numbers from the database into templates. Again here this is not analysis, you will only look at trends and calculate simple percentage increases or decreases or market share. For the Deal Researcher, your job will ONLY involve findings names for the M&A transactions advisor's. And if you want to write the comments to the quarterly reports. Debtwire, Your starting salary will be 28K if you gain a permanent role, could be higher, there has been cases of a starting salary up to 32K depending on experience. Here it all depends on how desperate they think you are. Salary increases depends a lot on the managers mood, generally 2-4K, but mostly 2K per year. Yearly bonus could be 3K-5K. You could probably negotiate a bit, but don\u2019t try to hard, this is a company where they generally only look at salary so if you are asking for to much then they will take someone who has less experience and asking for a lower salary. \u201cImportant\u201d, this is a department in Mergermarket Group, that recently had 6 employees leave all at the same time because they were so unhappy with their working environment. So you can imagine how bad it really is. The manager mistreated and bullied everyone in the team so they resigned and some even left without having another job. They generally take a lot of employees on a contract to keep salaries low, avoid providing benefits and to fire them without legal consequences. If you do a good job they will probably try and keep you on a contract as long as they can to keep costs down. CRM, Starting salary is 25K, same here no negotiation you accept or decline. Yearly increase is normally 500 pounds, with yearly bonus of 3K-8K. The actual work is simple client relations manager. You will give the users training on how to use the database and that\u2019s basically it. This is not sales. You will work close with the sales department and will have to do more or less what they tell you to do. The positive with this is that you are generally allowed to work without interference from managers and other colleagues. However, the job becomes very boring after a while, only individuals that are very demotivated would survive in this job. Normally people leave after 1 year. In general all positions in mergermarket is a maximum 1 year job, and the company knows this so they would rather see you leave to hiring someone with a lower salary then keep talent in the company. That is why their turnover is extremely high, if you join you will find that there are leaving drinks every month for someone. People leave as soon as they have some experience on their CV that they can use to apply for other jobs. Editorial, starting salary is normally 24K for someone with low experience, and they will keep this against you to maybe even offer a lower salary. Increases could be 2-3K depending on performance with a yearly bonus of 2K-5K. This is a sweatshop and employees are treated like cattle in a sink or swim environment, without meaningful training or discipline where favouritism seems to be the fastest track to promotion. The Managers in Mergarmarket Group is a mix bunch, some actually have knowledge and will treat you with the respect you deserve. But the majority are just clueless individuals that have been in the company since they started their career and have no idea about anything else except what they have learned in mergermarket. So basically nothing\u2026. There has been several cases of bullying because the manager doesn't like the person and also spying, to check when you leave on breaks and come back. The manager has also asked other colleagues to spy to get information about a employee. But don\u2019t worry you wont get fired, but you will hate your working environment so much that you either resign out of frustration or become very depressed. HR is a joke they have no say in anything and only do what upper management tells them to do. Bullying and mistreating employees is extremely common, it\u2019s a very sad and grey working environment to be in and if you join, start looking for a exit from day one. Be aware of this company, you will become very demotivated and at some point feel stuck and very depressed if you cant find something else. The company doesn't care about their employees its basically a sweat shop where you come in and do the job, (that a monkey could do) to then leave at 6pm sharp. Very important to understand is your experience will not be relevant for investment banking or credit analysis or any other \u201creal\u201d financial services job, and the M&A knowledge you gain is very basic and wont be relevant at any job. You will not gain any transferable skills, so you will have to exaggerate a lot on your CV to be able to get a better paying job.

You will have an idea about the management's ethics, professionalism and competence. Said that, let\u2019s go through all the company\u2019s departments and units. Wealthmonitor \u201cwm\u201d. The actual work you do is basic research and basic data entry, without any exaggeration you will become a vegetable if you do this job for to long. They basically want you to go through open sources and find a specific persons telephone number, address, interests and family members (Stocking people\u2026.). You then also calculate how much the person will get if they sell of their stake in the company. It\u2019s a very unscientific calculation based on the companies revenue, this is not analysis you will take the companies revenue and then based on a industry multiple calculate the value, A*B. This is basically the kind of job that you will start hating after 3-6 months, there is literally no career progression within the team, no ad-hoc work that you can do on the side, and no training. The work I described is what you will be doing, everyday\u2026. Mergermarket (mm) has two positions which they hire for, the Research Analysts but then also the Deal Researcher. For the Research Analyst position, your role will involve going though M&A transactions and copy paste relevant information from press releases. If there is a deal value you will add it if not, there will be no analysis to try and evaluate the company. In terms of financials you will look at the companies annual report and copy paste their revenue, EBIT, EBITDA and profit. And then for companies that provide a deal value calculate their net debt. Very simple work. On a quarterly basis you will also work on mergermarkets press releases, you will not write anything just add numbers from the database into templates. Again here this is not analysis, you will only look at trends and calculate simple percentage increases or decreases or market share. For the Deal Researcher, your job will ONLY involve findings names for the M&A transactions advisors. And if you want, write the comments to the quarterly reports. Debtwire: this is a department in Mergermarket Group, that recently had 6 employees leave all at the same time because they were so unhappy with their working environment. So you can imagine how bad it really is. The manager mistreated and bullied everyone in the team so they resigned and some even left without having another job. They generally take a lot of employees on a contract to keep salaries low, avoid providing benefits and to fire them without legal consequences. If you do a good job they will probably try and keep you on a contract as long as they can to keep costs down. CRM: the actual work is simple client relations manager. You will give the users training on how to use the database and that\u2019s basically it. This is not sales. You will work close with the sales department and will have to do more or less what they tell you to do. The positive with this is that you are generally allowed to work without interference from managers and other colleagues. However, the job becomes very boring after a while. People leave as soon as they have some experience on their CV that they can use to apply for other jobs. Editorial: this is a sweatshop and employees are treated like cattle in a sink or svim enviroment, without meaningful training or discipline where favouritism seems to be the fastest track to promotion. The majority of managers in Mergarmarket are just clueless individuals that have been in the company since they started their career and have no idea about anything else except what they have learned in mergermarket. So basically nothing\u2026. There has been several cases of bullying because the manager don't like the person and also spying, to check when you leave on breaks and come back. The manager has also asked other colleagues to spy to get information about a employee. HR is a joke they have no say in anything and only do what upper management tells them to do. Bullying and mistreating employees is extremely common, it\u2019s a very sad and grey working environment to be in and if you join, start looking for a exit from day one.
