Resources and investment is channelled towards endeavours that enable the creation and maintenance close business relationships, meaning each individual and each team are encouraged to host events, both large scale (e.g. quiz / curry nights) and more close and tactile events (such as Football boxes / Tennis / Cricket events) The business actively engages in local business community - participating in events such as the West Midlands Finance Awards, Birmingham Chambers Events and Women in Business events and encourages us all to get involved We are a big brand, we have a great back office and excellent central operations however locally, we can trade in a flexible enough way that we ensure our clients get a truly individual, flexible experience The local Management in each regional, and certain in my office are not time served veterans who have landed in a leadership role because of tenure and personal favour with the higher echelons - instead they are all proven deliverers at the coal face, who have a a good legacy of delivery in their local markets and add real value to the performance of the teams, the individuals in those teams and are never too far removed away from the coal face no matter how high they advance. The business constantly invests in technology, and have the best local infrastructure - which means our offices are in the right place, we have technology to be able to do our jobs where ever we are (home or at work or even on the move) and more so, the business encourages and trusts us with the flexibility that comes with being able to take our devices home and work from there. Flexibility is something that cant be overstated - all too often employers say that they are flexible but in reality people are chained to their office desks 95% of the working week - we really do have flexibility and a leadership team that trusts its people to embrace & value this flexibility, which is empowering in an industry that at times can be quite cynical of its own people's work ethic (hence chaining to their desks 95% of the time). Pay, bonus and benefits is brilliant - and is centred around everyone doing well, and benefiting from the fruits of this labour. What you don't have here is one or two person making eye wateringly colossal bonuses with everyone else being sold the promise of what they could earn but in reality, have to work 75 hours a week and feel like you are selling your soul to get a decent income / bonus... People get paid well, people get bonus and there really is a spirit of wanting to help everyone do well because well all benefit - we really are all in this together. Local leadership hire the right people, and consult with the team when making hiring decisions. In this way, we mitigate the risk that we hire the wrong type of personality for this environment so there is less frequency of people coming and going than in other places I have worked. I feel I have a career here, within a business that encourages me to be as good as I can be amongst a leadership team and peer group that I trust, are effective and will go above and beyond for me.. as I will for them. We have a big brand - and we actively seek to leverage of this brand - building local business relationships that in turn become national or tapping into global business that has presence in our local markets. We have a great culture here - locally the leadership team are attentive to ensuring the right type of culture and environment exists and persists.
