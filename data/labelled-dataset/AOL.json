You can move up within the company fairly quickly, if you know what you're doing, solid worker, and aren't too much of a slacker.

Cons Kiss up to management if you want to get anywhere, many directors do not know what they're doing let alone managers. Management won't help you unless you're one to kiss up to management and do exactly what they say when they say it. When they say jump, you better say how high. Tenureship doesn't mean anything and with multiple lay-offs happening 2-3 times a year, which is understandable, but the good employees who are solid workers, get the job done, been there over 10 years plus, and know what they're doing are the first to go. Racism, stereotypes, lack of leadership development skills, pettiness, favoritism, and sexual harassment happen on the daily. And again, unless you know a good manager who's been there a long time or on the good side of a director, they will NOT do anything about any of these issues. Dealt with racism from a director every day and sexual harassment from a co-worker and HR did NOTHING. If you want to work for a company that takes pride in that, this is the place to be. Advice to Management Look at who you are hiring, look at what jobs are actually being completed and targeted for success within projects, tasks, support, and management. You have a director in your company who is racist to individuals, make fun of individuals who he does not like, and he thinks it's funny and just having \"fun\". It's racist and should not be tolerated. Sexual harassment should NEVER be tolerated in the workplace and women in IT have to consistently prove themselves. Men have seen sexual harassment and are told be quiet about it and not say anything or they'll ensure they will not move up within the company or will be fired on the next lay-off.

AOL as a whole is a great company in that they offer amazing benefits (health care mostly covered by them, vision, dental, 401K with a company match, gym discounts, occasional happy hours, crazy holiday parties, etc.) but not all divisions there are created equal. Cons I worked for the video division, which was first 5 Min Media, then AOL On and now is under AOL One as part of the Vidible group. While I can recommend working for AOL the company, I cannot recommend working for AOL One or Vidible. At 5min/AOL On, everything was great. The team was happy, cohesive, comradery was strong and, best of all, supply was growing. Once management was taken over by the Vidible team though, it all of took a 160-degree turn. This is specifically why I am giving AOL 3 stars. I would give my first few years 5 stars and my last few years 1 star. As such, I\u2019m going with an overall three in this review. The CTO is a nightmare to work with or for. The man expects you to always be working. In his opinion family, your personal life, sleep, health etc. all come after work. He is an extremely arrogant man who couldn\u2019t care less for you or your partners. I once sat in a meeting with him where, when discussing how unhappy AOL On partners were with the abrupt and disastrous transition off of the AOL On platform to Vidible\u2019s, his literal advice was to show them the door but using much harsher language. You also better not have any of your own ideas or opinions because, if you do, he doesn\u2019t want to hear them. In his world, his opinion is the only one that matters and he can\u2019t be bothered with your feeble thoughts. AOL wasn\u2019t always like this. They used to encourage employees to speak up, push the boundaries, innovate and think out-side-the-box. Once Verizon took over and Tim Armstrong essentially disappeared. In other words, if you OK with working in an environment where you are expected to stand-in line, do as you are told and throw away any personal thoughts or opinions you have on improvements or innovation, this is the place for you. Otherwise, unless you desperately need a job or the offer is too good to pass up, I\u2019d recommend staying away from any position within AOL One. Advice to Management Adopt your old methods that help make AOL a great company once more. Back when Tim Armstrong first joined and started to turn the ship around.

You have to break your back to justify a title bump or pay raise and the career path is really unreasonable (e.g. ~9 years to reach a senior management position unless you're some kind of prodigy). - Extremely top heavy. The number of VPs and Directors is bizarre, unnecessary and probably won't last. - Constant reorgs. I believe there were three or four within a certain period 2015 to 2016. - All Hands meetings are absolute rubbish. You simultaneously get told you are the future of tech/advertising but also not hitting revenue. Every. Single. Meeting.

We got Patagonia vests, coffee mugs and t-shirts frequently. My daughter has a drawerful of AOL sleep shirts by now. Cons I worked at AOL for 15 years, if you count my time in the company AOL acquired. In that time I noticed several consistent themes: 1. Lack of vision..... It is no secret that AOL has been trying to reinvent itself, but they have been trying to do so without any clear plan or strategy. We have been operating under the \"strategy of the day\", which means that a given project may have high priority one day only to be on the chopping block the next. 2. Immediate gratification is required. Management has no follow-through, and is unable to accept that some products will take time. The halls of AOL are littered with dead projects that had been killed because management misunderstood the technology or the project would not have returned an immediate profit. Long term. strategy does not exist. sadly, a surpringly large portion of these projects would have implemented services that others outside AOL turned into very successful businesses. 3. Overly strong bias toward old technology... Within the engineering organization there is a heavy bias toward email and old technology, to the point where it is extremely difficult to integrate with newer technology. If your project was not related to mail, you were lucky if you received any support (the primary driver behind this is simple; a huge portion of AOL's page views come from webmail). Unfortunately, this has the effect of hamstringing other efforts. That's one of the reasons you'll find that AOL's instant messaging lags so far behind the industry, for example. 4. Exceptionally poor morale. Within the engineering organization there is a persistent pall, a sense that no matter what you may be doing, your job will eventually be considered \"extraneous\", and you'll be laid off. In my time at AOL I saw over 20 layoffs of varying sizes within engineering alone. Employees have developed a morbid sense of humor to deal with this stress. Management doesn't help with this by announcing most layoffs with no forewarning. It is not at all uncommon to see a coworker arrive as normal in the morning only to find by midday that they are unemployed. 5. No correlation between job ratings and actual performance... AOL recently started implementing stack ratings within engineering, which forces managers (many of whom have absolutely no direct experience with the employee) to force a normal distribution on employee skills. There is no recognition that it is possible to have a team comprised of above average skills. Annual ratings are developed by committees of managers, but a surprisingly large number of managers deciding I ratings have never worked with the employee being rated. This utter disconnect between ratings and actual job performance has turned the culture into one that stresses self preservation, knowledge hoarding, and unnecessary competitiveness. 6. Unwillingness to consider conflicting views.... I worked on a small team focusing on a line of business outside the mainstream consumer business. Our team was quite profitable, netting far more per capita than most businesses in the company. Moreover, our customers were highly dependent upon the services we offered. Management recently decided to shut down our team, laying off our staff. When our customers got word of the shutdown they became extremely upset and vocal. The decision to shut our team down was made by management without regard for the impact of the decision, and without any willingness to consider alternatives (e.g., spinning off, selling to competition, etc) 7. Very little potential for career growth... AOL has a very strong bias toward hiring younger people from outside the company over promotion from within. Combined with very few options for career/skill development, this results in an environment in which it is exceptionally hard for one to advance, (AOL does run a training organization that likes to boast of skill development, but the widely known secret is that very few of the staff can actually take advantage of this -- the chargeback to the employee's department pretty much ensures that budget constraints prevent training). Advice to Management Any advice I have for Tim Armstrong will be ignore, I'm sure. The Verizon deal will pretty much confirm that. However, if any AOL manager DO happen to read this, I offer the following: 1. Make a plan, and stick to it. Stop building products that you kill off before giving them any chances, or better still, decide on what products to build based on an actual strategy, not the whim of some clueless product manager. . 2. Start treating your employees with respect. Get rid of the stacked ranking and start rating employees on actual skills and results. Not everything in life follows a normal distribution. Another novel idea: Start promoting people from within. It is ex. ceptionally hard for an employee to advance at AOL; there is a strong tendency toward hiring new, younger staff over promotion from within. 3. Stop trying to make your financials look better by selling body parts. For too many years you have made your financials better by laying employees off. You have long since passed the point of \"optimizing\" productivity; most employees are now overworked and have no hope of being able to manage their workloads realistically. 4. Pay attention to your lines of business. Stop walking away from potential deals (yes, I have seen management reject deals on which our customers have approached us, deals that would have resulted in a higher net profit per capita). I understand that you need to focus on your core business lines, but if you have a profitable business unit perhaps it would be better to consider spinoffs or sales rather that layoffs.", "rating": 1, "pros": "Decent salary, and tons of corporate bling.

Multiple rounds of layoffs have left the \"lucky\" survivors seriously overworked. \u00a0AOL's portfolio is littered with the wrecks of companies they've acquired and run into the ground. They had an early leadership position in multiple market segments which they squandered. Let's look at some of the casualties and lost opportunities: - Bebo. Purchased for $850M, flaming wreckage sold back to the founder for $1M - Netscape. Once the top site on the internet and a technical leader in browser technology. At least the world got Firefox out of the deal. AOL shareholders got nothing. - Mapquest. Had a solid 3 year lead on Google Maps. Zero reinvestment and treating it like a cash cow squandered that lead and invaluable customer goodwill. - X-Drive: an early pioneer in cloud-based storage. Another leadership position lost, more goodwill flushed away - Time-Warner. Was supposed to move AOL into broadband via TW cable and bring TW media content online. All of the natural synergies were completely torpedoed due to boardroom bickering between billion-dollar egos. - Advertising.com - had an early lead over Google adwords, multiple opportunities to compete squandered, little reinvestment or innovation, misguided strategy that was doggedly pursued despite copious evidence they were hemorrhaging market share. Advice to Management First off, lose the AOL name. There is no goodwill left in the brand (if there ever was any to begin with) Second, resign in favor of people who actually understand the technology and the market you're competing in. Third, listen to the people in the trenches regardless of what their job title is. They know more than you think. Stop copying and start innovating again.

Time your vacations for good solid stretches/breaks between major deliverables and you can likely make use of it. There are big challenges ahead for AOL to grow two new business while the cash cow slowly dies, so there always a chance to learn and find success somewhere in the company. Embracing new technologies is encouraged where they provide the right technical solution to a problem. Learning how to deal with mountains of technical debt while adding to the pile of debt is also a learning challenge, but since upper-upper management doesn't care about really investing in paying that debt down, you might as well see how big of a funereal pyre you can make by adding some more things on top. At least you get to learn the technology as you heave it on top. While the constant change is mostly a negative, frankly if you can handle the change (or learn to) it will make you an extremely nimble person that is invaluable for your ability react quickly and appropriately and not spend time wondering who and where your cheese moved to. If you don't like change and a fast paced environment or can't understand why this is a valuable skill to obtain, then this clearly this is not a pro. Cons While change and the ability to react quickly is vital for a companies success, unreasoned change based on the cool new thing upper-upper management just read or heard about can be a recipe for doom. Not enough time is given to find success. Instead new mantras are chased on a regular basis without reasoning or fact. Then the next mantra comes along and a lot of work is abandoned. It is discouraging to everyone working on things, and while it teaches people how to react quickly, there is no other perceived benefit to the constant change. For a company where change is so very important to, there is an old guard (especially in technology) that refuses to change. They are a definite minority at this point, but there are enough of them that it hinders forward movement when we actually are given enough of a timeline to find success. That sabotaging is very unfortunate, as there is enough of pressure from the constant change management style from above, that we shouldn't fail when given the time needed to do the right thing due to \"well that never worked for AIM\".

It survives by layoffs, and top management is clueless", "text": "Pros The coffee is good, and we just got free Patagoia vests with an AOL logo on them. The food in the cafeteria is so-so, and we get corporate bling. Cons Where to begin? First, don't plan on a long tenure. The company is surviving by decreasing labor costs, which translates into layoffs once a quarter. It doesn't matter what your performance rating was, or what your skill set it. Layoffs are just a matter of life as an AOL employee. Second, expect no coherent direction. Senior management changes directions quite frequently, so you may find yourself working on a high priority one day only to find (usually through the grapevine) that your project isn't very important at all. Priorities change so frequently that it's difficult to keep track, and despite Tim's claims to the contrary, senior management doesn't bother to communicate. Third, don't expect career advancement. While friends of the senior management team tend to advance rapidly, others do not. In my 10+ years at AOL I saw only 3 people get promoted. Fourth, don't expect great raises. While Tim and his team bring home huge salaries, the staff receive paltry 1-2% raises. The idea of \"share the wealth\" does not exist at AOL. Fifth, do not expect brilliance at senior levels. While I found that the skills at the worker levels were extremely high -- there are some truly brilliant people working at AOL -- the same is not true of senior managers. Moreover, they tend to avoid trying to understand complex issues, preferring instead to reduce matters to simple PowerPoint decks. Senior managers are prone to rather stupid comments (remember Tim's \"distressed babies\") in staff meetings. The quarterly all-hands meetings were touted as a mechanism to make sure that everyone understood how the company was doing and that we were all focused on the right priorities, but instead were nothing more than rah-rah pep rallies to let the VPs talk about how great they were doing. Sixth, do not expect communications. While the team management team tries to convey goals and priorities to the staff, divisional and sub-divisional managers rarely provide any clues as to what is important, which projects we should be heading in what direction, or even how we're doing. It's a classic case of the staff working in a vacuum. Seventh, do not expect brilliance and innovation. The staff frequently comes up with ideas that rival some of the best on the net, but the product management team is intent on keeping their \"not invented here\" mentality. While we're encouraged to think outside the box, in reality new ideas are discouraged, to the point where money-making products are being shut down. Eighth, do not expect what you work on to ever go live. The halls of AOL are littered with products that were conceived, approved, developed, tested, and then killed without ever being released. Many of these products pre-dated competing products on the net, and some of those became quite successful. Staff layoffs and changing management priorities are killing innovation. Ninth, expect that mail is the sole and dominant priority. It is true that the majority of AOL visitors come from mail, but the emphasis on mail by senior management is preventing development of new products. They have not realized that mail has become a commodity on the net. Tenth, expect long hours and a high stress environment. While most managers tend to be flexible for work / life issues, the constant changing priorities, long hours expected, and constant layoffs combine to create a work environment that is anything but collaborative or productive. On any given day you may come into work to find that your project is dead and you are out of a job. There are more cautions to provide, but by now I hope the reader has an idea. Avoid AOL at all costs. Advice to Management Senior management is overpaid and clueless. Advice to the board: replace senior management. Advice to management: pick a priority and stick with it.

Experience with Industry standard, open and proprietary software and hardware platforms in a large environment. Pay was always above average although rarely excellent. AOL has gone through a lot of changes, which I allude to in the \"Con\" section, but it also still had some possibilities left open when I left. Although contracting from it's greatest size down to a smaller and spun-off successor organization, leaving Time Warner behind can only be considered a plus at this point. There are definitely places that AOL is working to grow in, and honestly, if they make good decisions, like avoiding debacles like Bebo, they can still pull something off. While I would never suggest someone who has never worked there apply for work there, I know enough people, and have enough experience there, that I might consider a position there again... assuming they can pull it together and get back some energy like they used to have. Cons AOL was clearly a company consumed by terrible past business decisions, and so it's outlook was always going to be rocky. Starting at a time where the millionaires of the IPO and Time Warner merger were not just old stories, it's clear that the AOL I worked for was still a leader, but in it's current incarnation, well past it's prime. While I was never personally affected by layoffs, there was the constant threat of it hanging over the heads of everyone at the end of the year. Many good people were let go in masses at those times. Note, I have not been at AOL for a while, and when I left, even the headquarters campus was being leased off from the original seven, crowded buildings when I started, down to just three, and the actual HQ for the company had moved to NYC, far from it's technical roots. Unless you know that you are going to work on something extraordinary there, it's just a job, and it may well be a depressing one at that, considering that if you walk the corridors at CC2/CC1/HQ, you can tell that it used to be something special almost on the order of excitement of working at Google might be today. Advice to Management In AOL's current incarnation, I have little advice to offer management, as it has been years since I've been there. All I can say is that AOL needs to find a place in something new. Throw off the old big corporation mindset, and you've got a chance, otherwise, your days of being a leader are over permanently. Tim Armstrong was a new CEO at the time I left, and at that time, he was trying to turn things around. My impressions at the time of him were a little positive, but not particularly well formed. Past management, however, was ridiculously bad, particularly at the top.

Over the years, as the company grew, in both scope and the size of it's fear of almost everything. I would say the best reason to work for AOL is the lack of accountability. If you are good and smart, you can work there almost forever, without having to ever account for a single mistake you've done. In fact, if you are really good, you could come off as some sort of genius for completely screwing up a project. The reason why I say that is the \"best\" reason? is because job security.

Advice to Management I have 2 simple advice for the senior management and they are as follows, 1) Grow some balls and actually follow through, instead of jumping around trying to hop on the next trend so you can look good in your exec suite with your other exec bodies when you play buzz word bingo. Sometimes, a buzzword is just that, it doesn't actually help you with your business, and only true risk taking and consistent work at perfecting an idea will turn it into a gem in the end. Bandwagon often just takes you off a cliff. 2) Treat your people like real human beings instead of a machines to do your bidding. If you hire good people like you say you have, then trust them with the ability to make decisions at every level, stop trying to micromanage every single decision because you're afraid of a mistake.

This Microsoft and AOL partnership really could have been something marvelous instead everyone seems lost with no clear direction on where we are heading and how to make this successful. There will always be the \"talk\" of how everyone is happy and everything is running smoothly, but it's lies and every employee knows it. They need to stop treating us as if we are ignorant. Logic is ceases to exist here at all. When asking why certain process are in place there is no clear answer apart from \"that's how we do things here\". How is this going to be successful when the management can't take on suggestions about how to do things better. Microsoft partnering with AOL was a very bad move indeed. It's a complete shambles compared to the wonderful company we came from. We've been successful and how we did things worked there, hence why we achieved quota year after year (Have AOL been achieving quota every year? NO is the answer). This will be the first time it will be a failure and it's because they can't get off their pedestals to take on suggestions that can make things better around here. The calibre of talent at AOL is unimpressive compared to Microsoft and Milennial Media. Especially the managers running the teams, they are not good leaders and quite simply are drowning. A good manager and leader takes on the feedback from people working the job day to day but here nobody wants to entertain change. These same managers would never have been hired had they applied for a position at Microsoft. The difference in talent is crystal clear. There is clearly so much resentment from AOL folk when we came here, especially around taking on the top positions. Maybe this happened because the Microsoft employees are a level above. While I'm on the topic, people should take a moment to reflect on why Microsoft partnered with AOL. It wasn't because we were a failing business. It was because Microsoft wanted to have a larger focus on their software/hardware and search businesses. So AOL'ers should perhaps take that on board when they think about why we are here. We were a success there and we can be a success here if they actually take on board the changes that need to be made.

On the flip side, if you prefer to be a heads down executor there is plenty of things to do to make sure the company is running smoothly and supporting the change and innovation going on around you... just make sure you change and adapt as required, but in general if you like to deliver consistently, there is probably a role for you somewhere at AOL as well. The culture at AOL has improved significantly and continues to. Realizing that a company has a culture which can be shaped through talent selection and just reflecting on it is a big step that a lot of companies haven't taken like AOL has. While it can be thought of us a non-important part of a company, folks have to remember they're likely to spend more of their lives at work than anywhere else, why not find a culture that you can respect and appreciate and surround yourself with it. More mundane things: AOL UnUniversity is an excellent program where employees share their knowledge with other employees; much better than the standard structured corporate classes. Time away from work is encouraged to recuperate when there is a bit of a break in the bustling work of rebuilding a company; that time away is supported with 3-5 weeks vacation a year and 12 holidays. We finally have a good insurance company in Cigna; prior primary offering of United Health left a lot to be desired and alternative BC/BS was just okay at best. Cons Sometimes vision is muddled with strange phrases and ideas such as calling our primary websites cities and smaller websites towns with bridges and tunnels between them to recirculate traffic and other support infrastructure like power plants and other weirdness; a lot of the staff (generally the 1500 or so technologist) just scratch their heads wondering why such colorful phrases are used to represent relatively straightforward topics. The employee ranking/rating system seems to have gotten better for 2012 reviews; but it still can encourage backstabbing amongst the employees and generally is not positive for employee morale. Most folks do appreciate differentiated bonus/stock based on performance so in order to meet that desire they understand that ranking must occur. However having a minimum (or even a target %) of people to fill bottom buckets of Not Meeting Expectations and Off-Track of Expectations is completely bonkers. Fire people when the need to be fired, put them onto Performance Improvement Plans when they need to be, but do not automatically assume there is a certain percentage of employees that fall into those categories. There still is not as tight of a integration between Product and Technology as there should be. This does not mean they have to report to the same boss, but Product and Technology do have to collaborate at all stages from initial idea to deployment to ensure success. Things are starting to improve here over the last 9 months or so. Advice to Management Keep it up!!!
