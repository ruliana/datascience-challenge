Senior management in Memphis is stubborn in its decision-making, refusing to budge even after following a course that is clearly wrong-headed. Corporate overseers in London are often overbearing and uncaring. Very collectivist mindset with regard to compensation as opposed to willingness to reward outstanding individual achievement. Tom Scott is the CEO, not Bruce Scherr as the Glassdoor default indicates.", "advice": "Get back to recruiting, investing in, and rewarding/retaining extremely talented people and valuing their contributions and ability to crank out high-quality content to clients or prepare for a big hit to your reputation and possible death spiral of the business structure.", "predicted": "customer"}, {"title": "sales", "text": "Pros company phone, happy hours, semi-inolved management Cons very poor training, high stress environment Advice to Management more organized training program", "rating": 3, "pros": "company phone, happy hours, semi-inolved management", "cons": "very poor training, high stress environment", "advice": "more organized training program", "predicted": "result"}, {"title": "Not as bad as it could be but could be much better, no doubt.", "text": "Pros -Big company name that will supplement you resume/ CV -Exciting industry as a whole -Excellent networking opportunities -Nice people -Good benefits -You do not have to earn PTO, it is given up front -Educative -Depending on what your role is, the bonus incentives are quite generous -Travel opportunities (both domestic and abroad) Cons -Below market pay -Poor interdepartmental communication -Very disorganized -Nontransparent -Undefined company culture -Frequent dips down into low team morale -Leadership from Upper Management is uninvolved -Can be a very \"sneaky\" and \"hush, hush\" environment -Little investment into the employee Advice to Management -Excellent job on staying involved in a leading edge and innovative industry. As a whole, the company direction seems clear. -Strengthen the communication channels between departments and regions, a simple monthly newsletter does not suffice for delivering collective knowledge. -Try to better organize things from the business side. Events seem scrambled and discombobulated when you do not give a step-by-step game plan for how to work an event. This disorganization is compounded when you have weak communication between teams. -Define a company culture. True, there are \"values\" mentioned when hiring on, but these seemed contrived and vague, at best. Make it a place where people will want to work by establishing a culture that breeds success and motivation. Turn over rate is high because people who do not seem to jive with the team are constantly hired. Take a step back and bring in the right people that will further the enjoyment of others working here, along with the company as well. -Weak company culture, plus all the points mentioned thus far, lead to a low team morale. Constant back talking and gossip are all too frequent within the company. It seems like everyone has several issues that they need to vent about, which should suggest an investigation into overall staff satisfaction. -Greatly improve leadership presence, perhaps even enroll your management in proper leadership training. It may be a blow to your managers' egos, but at the end it will increase productivity and morale. Managers will have a better awareness of how to successfully manage a team and employees will rest assured knowing that their manager has the right mindset to lead. There is an obvious gap between the team and the leader. While it may not be intentional, this gap comes off as apathy towards the team, from the leader. Occasional emails of encouragement, or better yet, team bonding will motivate your employees by letting them know you care. We spend much of our daily lives working for you, why not get to know more about us, and us about you? -Create and encourage more transparency. This partially ties into poor communication too, but the opaque nature of this company creates disorganization and distrust. Things, big things, are going on all the time that are not made known: important people are leaving, changes to the event are occurring, moves being made regarding the naming and branding of events. Even a low level employee should be involved when changes to the event that they are working on are happening. -Invest back into your employee. Before I articulate myself on this point, know that I always feel conflicted mentioning this. Reason being is that we get paid and live off our salary for this job. That, in theory, should be enough employee investment. However, in this day in age, the bar had been raised with tech companies/ start ups revolutionizing the modern day work place. Provide better computers to your employees, that way they won't waste time trying to get their programs to work or dealing with other avoidable technical issues. Set up team off-sites to encourage team bonding and camaraderie. Look more into employee training programs. These can be great both for the company and the employee. A better trained employee will do a better job. Doing this will also foster creation and innovation.", "rating": 3, "pros": "-Big company name that will supplement you resume/ CV", "cons": "-Below market pay", "advice": "-Excellent job on staying involved in a leading edge and innovative industry.

The obvious choice by this company was to promote the crappy guy because he was in with upper management. Terrible Pay - I have heard that the starting pay is around $30,000 per year for an entry level job. This is barely enough to live.

Vague bonus structure - Ask them about their bonus structure if you work there. You will never get an answer as to how it is calculated. They will also lie to you in the interview process about how much it will be. They claimed 1800-2000 per quarter. The most I got was 700 dollars gross. Did not honor my resignation date - When I knew I was leaving I gave them a little bit more than 2 weeks of notice because I knew they would be in a jam. Instead, they told me to leave early and did not pay out my final bonus. Hilariously, I received e-mails at my new job for help! All in all, this company is a joke.

Advice to Management Simplify the structure. You are too top heavy. If you want to act like a modern, nimble business, make decisions which don't need 12 people to sign off on them, Perhaps ask the people working directly with the products what to do rather than spend money on consultants and more layers of product management doing NIHITOs - to then just go and do what we would have suggested anyway.

Cons - Management are terrible, they make you work so hard for little to no money - They never stick up for your arguments. To busy helping themselves. -Shocking accounts. They offer every firm a discount 50% plus. BD reps just mail merge all leads and send the same exact email every week. - BD reps sit there roaming around your accounts and trying to steal your sales. - Lad atmosphere and some of the most unmotivated sales people ever. Sit emailing to get sales by offering 80% off the RRP price. - I have now left the firm, who I was owned commission by. They said they would pay me from January to May a total sum of between worse case scenario and best case scenario. I have now waited 6 months for them to conclude \"investigations\" on my accounts and they have confirmed to me that they will not pay any outstanding owing. Lets just say it was a five figure amount and was then reduced to four figures. They actually sent a form and settlement figure and after asking them to send a revised form with the correct details, they ignored the facts and ended up letting me know via an email they will not pay. After being voted Account manager of the year and bringing in more money then there best sales person in the team. This is how they reward hard working individuals. STAY AWAY AT ALL CASE.
