You will be based in BOS or JFK out of training and inflight does a good job of getting you resources to find housing in your new base. The inflight team and your co-workers are a great support system. Jetblue offers free unlimited flight benefits in core(main cabin) to you and your family. Jetblue does not oversell seats so the chance of you actually getting a seat on standby is much greater than at other airlines. They also offer a decent Healthcare package. Cons Low pay compared to the industry. This may be a pro for some if you live at your base but you don't fly much on reserve except for holidays and irregular operations. On the average, you will fly 35-40 hours monthly (in JFK). You are paid on the 8th and 20th with your average paycheck of $500 after taxes. The only way you can make extra money is to peddle the JetBlue credit card on your flights and for every approved application, you get $25. If you get sick, no matter what the case may be, you are penalized by the current point system. It covers 4 days in which you have to call in each day to extend it (if on reserve). You qualify for FMLA after a year. The reserve system is one of the worst in the industry with restrictions that affect your quality of life. If you live in your base, you will like it a lot better than if you commute. The system is very restrictive. To pick up trips as a reserve, it's done in seniority order with no transparency and the most archaic software around (Sabre circa 1970). You can forget about picking anything up if you are new. The system freezes more often than not. Your flight benefits are free unless you want to fly in MInt (JetBlue's version of Business Class). You will be charged $75 (via credit card not payroll deducted) just to list (which is refundable if you don't get the seat). You also are required to do a blue turn or clean debris out of the seat back pockets and cross seatbelts when you are working and when you are onboard for non-revenue travel when the plane arrives at its destination. All work groups are suppose to do it but some pilots do not. The free labor aspect is an embedded value in the JetBlue culture and many crewmembers would argue that they aren't being taken advantage of in this way. This really isn't the best time right now to begin as a flight attendant as the airlines plans for expansion have been delayed with issues from the manufacturer creating a surplus of reserve flight attendants. No one is happy. Lineholders aren't able to pick up trips and fly over 90 hours if they choose and reserves just sit at home or on stand by at the airport hoping to fly. Make sure you have a Netflix account. You will need it to manage your boredom. Also right now the airline is trying to prevent the flight attendants from unionizing, so propaganda is strong on both sides. However, you almost feel that the airline is taking it personal instead of fixing the many problems with flight attendant bidding software and the overall inflight experience. Management talks a good game about unity but so far, the benefits from those \"feel good\" talks are slow to materialize. Advice to Management More transparency with your crewmembers.
