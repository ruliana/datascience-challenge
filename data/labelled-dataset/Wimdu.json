Die meisten Praktikanten, die eingestellt werden, sind sich nicht bewusst, dass das nicht ist, was ein Praktikum sein sollte - zwar ist die Arbeit nicht schwer, aber alles, was man lernt, l\u00e4sst sich in 2 Stunden erz\u00e4hlen. Arbeit besteht immer und immer wieder aus den gleichen niederen Aufgaben. Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Problem k\u00f6nnte sein, dass das Management - vor allem Arne Bleckwenn und Hinrich Dreiling, keine Ahnung haben, wie man mit Menschen umgeht und ein Unternehmen f\u00fchrt. Ihr Mangel an direkter und intelligenter F\u00fchrung verst\u00e4rkt nur das Gef\u00fchl, dass Wimdu ein Copy-Cat-Klon von AirBnb auf der Suche nach einem schnellen Exit (den sie klar verpasst haben) ist. Sobald das Geldverbrennen von Rocket Internet nachl\u00e4sst, wird die Firma zusammenklappen. Terrible management, or better the lack of management. The company lacks clears goals or structures. The company is built up on interns, while several key positions are filled by inexperienced employes. While the general atmosphere amongst the teams could be describe as good, the general company atmosphere sways between frustration and disappointment. While there isnt generally anything wrong with hiring interns, the company hires them as a cheap labor alternative with no real intention of keeping them on board for the long term, which results in a constant state of disorganization and loss of knowledge. Most interns who get hired, aren't aware that this isn't what an Internship should be like - and while the work isn't hard, everything that one learns can be summed up in 2 hours. Work consists of the same menial tasks over and over again. The biggest issue might be the fact that the management - especially Arne Bleckwenn and Hinrich Dreiling have no clue how to \"people manage\" and run a company. Their lack of direct and intelligent leadership only enhances the feeling that Wimdu is a copy cat clone of AirBnb looking for a quick exit (which they have clearly missed). Once the burn money from Rocket Internet subsides, the company will fold. Advice to Management Klare Unternehmensziele definieren. Erstellen Sie eine richtige Hierarchie. Setzen Sie Priorit\u00e4ten.
