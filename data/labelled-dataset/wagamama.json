Sections are very large and you're expected to stay completely on top of everything whilst still making small talk with customers about their day-very very stressful for rubbish pay. -Very shiny, friendly surface- there is this idea that wagamama is such a lovely individual place to work but really they treat you like numbers like any other big company, it's just a business strategy. -Team leaders on huge huge power trips -Managers often so stressed they take it out on their staff -When you want to drink water on shift you have to crouch behind the bar so customers don't see you, as if customers will be put off their food by seeing staff drinking? -Shift patterns crazy- split shifts often require you to take a three hour break, and if the restaurant isn't close to your house this means you have to hang around the area or the restaurant -On long shifts you'll be standing up for up to 12 hours and only get a 20 minute lunch break, in which you have to go to the staff room and change back in to your own clothes because again the customers cant see staff eating? So odd, still don't see the point. -The menu! There are literally hundreds of items and dishes you have to learn the corresponding numbers to, which are not in order, and you have to learn what ingredients are in all of these dishes, and how they are made! If you don't have all of this learnt in your first two-three weeks managers and team leaders get very very annoyed. -There is sometimes not enough hours to go around because management want to cut down on the cost of staff so much, I was forced to take a paid holiday day when they canceled on of my shifts, and it happened to everyone until they managed to get rid of some staff permanently. Advice to Management Don't give your staff 20 mins for lunch and get changed twice! Hire more people so everyone feels supported, 3-5 people doing 100+ covers is horrible.

Friendly Environment (e.g. FOH team come into your pot-wash area regularly and have small talk with you - also getting to know you and gossip lol) Breaks during quiet times. (e.g. If you can't work for long period 7am-3pm, take your break at ~11am/12pm or if you leave it later then you won't be able to unless you have another kp to cover you). Preparing/Serving Desserts (e.g. This is the \"fun\" part of the job, you get a break from the hot pot-wash area and prepare desserts for customers, learning them off by heart can be hard but there is a manual to help. Unfortunately in my experience - not a lot of people decide to buy desserts :( ) High pay-rate (e.g. Starting at \u00a37.20/hr + tips) Get to go to the cool/calm stock area (e.g Another break from the hot pot-wash area, keep stocked up on ice-cream and desserts/sauces) Weekends are really relaxed especially Sunday (e.g. all your deadlines for jobs are shifted by 30mins/1hr so you have more time to do things and take it a lot more slowly). You can choose your days off. Only do this job - If you are looking to progress up to a line-chef/looking for a long-term career (working your way up from the bottom) as soon as you get the hang of the kp role, this job is not easy and you must be ready and willing every day to get all the tasks done asap. You must not be scared of cleaning and getting your hands dirty. You must be willing to wake up early to get to work. Would NOT recommend this as your first job (don't make the mistake I did and do this as you will not enjoy it some days - they made the job sound much nicer on the application page and recruitment day) , it is HARD and it is NOT easy. You have to work quickly and efficiently and be able to multitask! You have to be a quick learner that just needs money for some things. I wouldn't recommend this as a long-term job, try to move up or out of this job because it's not a fun one - I just do my job, go home and get paid every Friday (I guess pay-day is something to look forward to). A full time role as a kp is tough. Cons Early Starts (7am starting times is pretty annoying - I have to wake up at 5am just to get there relatively on-time.) Lots of lifting heavy things (e.g. Oil cartons/Trays/Rice containers etc.) Lots of cleaning (e.g. 80% of the job is Cleaning. Plates all the time during busy times and cleaning used prep trays during the morning). Very difficult to keep up on tasks when you are on your own (e.g. Getting chicken cooked and prep'd , and then cooking rice before 9:30 so it's ready for the chefs) Can get really hot in the pot-wash area (e.g The dishwasher/glass-washer is on all the time and you need to use hot water to wash the stuff, so drink water readily.) You have to change the oil for the deep-fryer which is the worst task of the day (e.g. You need to empty the oil into empty oil cartons and clean out all the crumbs/foodstuffs that have made it to the bottom of the fryer yuck.) Stressful when its a busy day (e.g. Lots of plates and requests from chefs!) Cleaning curry pots (e.g. You get them around mid-day and they are a nightmare to clean so leave them to soak and come back later) Taking the bins from outside into the bin room (e.g. You get people looking at you funny when you do this and the bin room is like a sauna, you have to be quick with this job as it takes up your time for the other jobs.)
