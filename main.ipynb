    "(refer to README for the challenge description)\n",
    "\n",
    "My first approach was to stick to the basics: TF-IDF + Naive Bayes. The results were no good, so I tried several flavors of SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is simple, fast and had some great results in the past for text classification. I try it first to have a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM seems to be one of the best in the present days, unless we go to Neural Networks, I guess, so it was my next step. The classification accuracy increased a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't reach accuracy over 90% as the pre-requisites, probably my data preparation is poor. I tried stemming, but the results didn't improved much. Maybe Latent Semantic Analysis to identify synonyms, but it seem too much right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you asked for >90% accuracy in 2-4 hours, my feeling is that I'm missing something really obvious here. But...\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway... my next steps would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Talk to someone more experienced on that (in a real situation, of course).\n",
    "2. Search a little more for another algorithm.\n",
    "3. Experimenting with feature engineering, the algorithms don't make miracles, but playing with the features usually leads to big improvements. That's were I'm probably missing something, like separate Pros and Cons.\n",
    "4. Spend a little more time doing Grid Search. It's slow, but requires only computer time, and also it can improve a lot some models.\n",
    "5. Precision and Recall. I wouldn't finish this without calculate them. IMHO, they provide a good picture of the model performance. Accuracy can be misleading,\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I would create separate models for each language. The stemming in languages that have more verb flexion (latin languages mostly) can make a bigger difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I made a big mistake here, I tried to use the whole data set for all algorithms. It's fast for the MultinomialNB and SGDClassifier, but it was really slow with the other algorithms I tried (SVC, NuSVC, XGBoost). That made me spend a lot of time just waiting instead of play more with the features."
