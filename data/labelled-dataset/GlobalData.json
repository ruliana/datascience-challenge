Good suggestion by one of the reviews below to each out for lunch every day. Paying the typical \u00a38 for lunch in the area is not cheap on analyst salaries but analyst should prioritise networking over social life. GD recognises that in other companies the paying of bonus in highly politicised and controversial, so good decision on punishing everyone equally. Unlike other companies, GD is not elitist in anyway.

Office is in a good central London location. Decent starting salary for a graduate. Good opportunity to learn about healthcare industry and develop skills for future career (primary research and forecasting skills are very valuable). There are opportunities to get involved in consulting projects which does provide some respite from writing reports. Allowed to work from home once a week, sometimes more Very relaxing working environment, you\u2019ll never feel under any pressure Cons While you do learn a lot as an analyst, once you\u2019ve written your first report there is literally no point doing another as you\u2019ll never develop any more skills. You can get involved in consulting projects, although that is about the only decent opportunity available. Day to day life is very boring and mainly involves writing based on secondary research and doing little to no analysis at all. It gets very dull, very quickly and in all honesty it\u2019s a very easy job. The role is so mundane you can basically switch your brain off all day. There is no pressure on you at all which means people become stagnant and productivity is really poor. Most analysts will do one report in six months or more but in reality these timelines could he halved if anyone actually cared about their job enough to work properly. Ultimately, the job role as an analyst is just not stimulating at all. The lack of communication throughout the company is astonishing. Senior management are terrible at checking in on analysts and communicating the most basic of things. It feels like from day 1 analysts are hung out to dry with zero support from anyone senior, and you can genuinely sit at your desk all day and not do a single bit of work and no one even notices. This should not be allowed to happen, and it wouldn\u2019t if senior management actually cared. I will point out that this is not the case for all senior managers, some of whom are very competent and do care about analysts\u2019 progression, but in general it\u2019s a very poor show. The office is a complete joke \u2013 no hot water, fridge or microwave despite numerous petitions. All facilities are terrible and it is genuinely the worst office I could ever imagine anyone in a developed country would have to set foot in - you have to see it to believe it. It\u2019s probably nicer in Guantanamo Bay. Morale among employees is incredibly low \u2013 everyone constantly moans about their jobs and the company which creates a very depressing environment to work in. Turnover is really high (one analyst leaves every 2 weeks at least) which makes things worse. Senior management do not care about this, however, as it is part of the business model, so don\u2019t expect things to change any time soon. IT infrastructure is woeful. Most of the phones and Ethernet cables in meeting rooms do not work. You would think the company is on its last legs financially, and the whole places reeks of under investment and a lack of quality. Long hours (9-6) and only 20 days holiday, 3 of which have to be saved to use over the Christmas break when the company is closed anyway, so essentially you only get 17 days holiday which is an absolute joke. Overall, GlobalData is not an enjoyable place to work. It will literally suck the life out of you. It is a terrible environment to work in and I would say that well over half of current analysts are looking to leave/want to leave. GlobalData can offer you a job, not a career. It can be a good stepping stone and many employees go on to work in very good roles upon leaving. Bottom line \u2013 GlobalData needs a major overhaul, the company is a joke. Advice to Management Invest in your employees. Even if a high turnover is part of the business model, there is no need to make employees lives so miserable while they are at the company. After all, it is the analysts who write the reports that make you money. Without them, you\u2019ve got nothing, and soon enough you\u2019ll have no analysts. Give employees some sort of benefits package \u2013 literally anything is better than what we get now. Who knows, maybe some employees might actually start to like working for you! As employees get nothing, they give nothing in return. Give us something and we will give you something back. Pretty obvious right?!

The fact that there are so many positive reviews makes me strongly suspect many have been written by shills at the instruction of senior management, something that is highly characteristic of their approach to problems at the company. The IT is the biggest joke of any company I have ever worked at - there are far too few staff in this department, and the vast majority of the computers are well below the specs they should be for the roles they are being used to support. Much of the software used is also decades old, and often unsuitable. The vast majority of the teams are also woefully underesourced, with a fraction of the staff needed to do the work at hand properly. Many have no budgets for basic things to support their work, and it is not uncommon for people to end up funding things out of their own pockets simply to do their jobs properly. There is an unwillingness to spend money on anything, no matter how much of a good business case it is, with employees expected to work miracles and match rivals with budgets ten times the size. Communication between the senior management and the rest of the staff is almost non-existent, with changes coming out of the blue, and contradictory decisions being made on a regular basis. Staff with expertise are never consulted on decisions, meaning many of those made are totally unworkable. The average pay is well below market rate. Regular pay rises do not exist, and attempts to negotiate pay increases are made near impossible by the fact that non-managerial employees do not have access to anyone with the power to approve them. There is also little in the way of career progression opportunities. The company also breaks people. There is a fairly abusive culture, with employees often being very aggressive to each other, and refusing to support each other when required. This appears to stem from the attitude of the CEO and trickles down through the company. This combined with the lack of resources results in many people becoming highly stressed and burning out. The office is also filthy, and too small for the number of people who work there. This is a terrible place to work. Do not work here if you have any other options.
