As a current Gorkana employee, it's pretty apparent that the past few negative reviews were conspired through a handful of former employees - who, at least from my view, didn't show much interest in the job or had trouble understanding why they didn't move up the ladder. Three years ago the culture and atmosphere of Gorkana was great, but the company lacked direction and had trouble growing in the US. The \"much maligned\" Managing Director (at least on this site) had a very big hand with getting Gorkana US on a successful track. As with every manager/boss, if you learn how to work for them, you will find success. Over the past two years we've seen the number of clients grow, including the Enterprise business, which has brought on some high-end, blue chip brands as clients (after years of not bringing on any client of global stature). She may be tough to work for, forget a name here and there, or come off as a bit strong willed at times, but the MD absolutely got the job done in getting the Gorkana US office running right. Personally, while I have butted heads with her, I've learned a lot as well and like the track my career is on with Gorkana. With the merger of Cision finally coming to fruition, there is a lot of opportunity for those that remained with Gorkana during that odd period of transition. Yes, it;s difficult to go from that start-up, atmosphere - but in the end those that stuck it out and/or showed a willingness to commit, will find good opportunities for success. Cons The culture has taken a bit of a hit, due to recently being acquired by Cision and in turn a lot of the team has left and were not replaced. A lot of talent and personality was lost, but not much could be done about it - as there were no guarantees that could be made regarding roles during the transition. That being said, management did encourage employees to look for roles and to take advantage of the opportunities that came to them and did not try to stand in the way. Backfilling those roles didn't happen because they couldn't hire somebody to a FT position without being able to guarantee a role more than a few months. The office is tight and cramped, which can make it difficult if you're on a call or just want to put your head down and get some work done.

Raises and promotions are rewarded with little regard for merit or work ethic. Think you're getting overtime for those swanky events you're attending? Think again. It's a policy to only award two hours of overtime for employees who attend the events, even if you're expected to be there for three hours or more. Or, alternatively, they might just come by your desk the day before an event you've committed yourself to working to tell you that you won't, in fact, be receiving any overtime at all! Surprise! What a joy it is to work for management that flagrantly flouts labor laws with the hope that their entry-level employees are too naive to know it's wrong. Traveling for work?! Yeah, you probably won't get overtime for that either. Will the Managing Director remember your name and your role at the company? Nahhhhh. But she will be upset if you try to remind her.

They work on the basis that the majority of people will only work there a short time, which leads them to care very little about morale, career development, or overall employee satisfaction. The net result is a department with very high staff turnover, which places a very high burden of responsibility of the longer term employees and means that the quality of work the company is able to produce fluctuates very wildly. The salaries offered are comparatively low, which means during the current competitive economic environment only inexperienced and sub-par candidates are hired in new roles. In addition to analysis, this is also an issue in IT support, product development, HR, and customer support. Overall this means that the general direction and growth of the company is severely hampered by inexperience and incompetence at all levels. The senior managers are also very chummy with each other, which further creates problems whereby even people that have been proved to be incompetent get shuffled to another department. Company systems and products are roughly all 10 years old, which makes the day to day job difficult and also means the company consistently loses business to more modern competitors. The HR team oversee a sickness policy that potentially that means you are ineligible for inflation or performance linked pay rises if you are ill more than three times in six months. More than seven absences in 18 months can result in dismissal. Needless to say this policy is neither effective at combating spurious absences or addressing the persistent morale and staff turnover problems. Advice to Management A very serious audit needs to be undertaken into the suitability of the various Operations teams and department heads. They have consistently led the company on a downward path over the past three years and are increasing the type of attitudes and policies that have created the initial problems. Management needs to also be much more transparent. Serious announcements on the direction of the company are routinely leaked. Management then denies the speculation, only to announce that it is true several months later.

There are a lot of people around who are extremely capable and good at their jobs which is a great motivator to improve and provides a benchmark for the level you should be aiming at. I was actually in two minds about whether to post here but, after reading through quite a few negative comments, I felt that I needed to put a few things right. So, with that said... There are next to no problems with the hardware apart from a couple of issues with my PC freezing up which was resolved without any further problems. The PCs themselves are good machines(they were replaced recently and now all run on Windows 7) and everyone has dual screens and a spacious working area and comfortable chair. There are probably a few too many systems to work with than there need to be but this is to be expected after merging companies and does not present a major hindrance to carrying out day to day work. Another thing that I felt I needed to comment on was the negative views toward management. I have no idea of any of the gossip that someone alluded to but, in my experience, the management I have dealt with have been really great to work with. I am trusted to do my work, helped when I ask for it, encouraged to experiment with optimisation and improvements, kept updated of changes, or sometimes even possible changes, and treated with respect. They also seem like pretty nice people who I could definitely have a pint with. I'm not claiming to know every manager in the building but I can definitely say that my experience of the management team here has been nothing but positive. Similarly, I have only good things to say about my hiring process and HR in general. My hiring process was seamless and I was kept updated of the progress all along the way. My interviews were moved to one day, with my approval asked for beforehand, which meant I had one trip less and I found out on the day of interview its outcome. HR here respond to emails promptly which I have never experienced before in any job, and you do not feel treated like a \"human resource\" at all. The three people I have met there were friendly and helpful and have continued to be so. The Wifi code is not given to employees as it is for clients only but your internet access is not restricted in any other than the usual ways, gambling etc. I can't really speak to the previous comments on self-development and promotion as I am not here long enough to see much promotion but I can say that the opportunity to develop yourself is definitely there. There are plenty of online courses on the intranet and I have been encouraged to study and learn. One that I took was probably a little inflexible in the exactness of the correct answers but the facility and intent is there. I have also done a lot of learning for a project that I have taken on and, provided your BAU work continues to meet the agreed standard, you won't, in my experience, be impeded in improving or learning this way. There is also a really great resource available which provides redacted or summarised books on the intranet or to a mobile device. These allow you to get the gist of a book on something interested in but don't have time to read the entire book and is a great resource. Development opportunity is there if you want it. The perks are pretty good too once you come out of your probation with a 50% per month gym discount, cycle to work scheme, season pass loan and others. The offices are nice and bright with lots of space although you do need to go to a different building to visit some departments. The canteen does really good food too with an onsite chef and team at very reasonable prices. Finally, it's in a great location and you're close to a number of gyms, banks, supermarkets, a post office and bars and restaurants which mean you can get a lot done on your lunch break and, most importantly, there is no pressure to stay late and leaving on time is not looked down on. Great place to work with nice and friendly people around you. Cons The salary is lower than I would hope for and, based on my own research, significantly lower than the industry average for my role. Although the company is trying to encourage a greater team spirit(there is a cabinet of employees who run some cool competitions and fun events) they could put a bit more money into it. Having said that, pizza was bought for our floor a few weeks ago but some more company subsidised events would be nice. I've spent about 5 minutes trying to think of another, and can't, so I'll leave it there! In short, with a more generous salary I would have given a 5/5 rating. Advice to Management Keep the lines of communication open and keep employees up to date and in the loop with upcoming changes. Keep acting transparently. Review salaries with regard to National and London averages. There are people with a very, very niche skill set(I'm thinknig of the Production floor in particular) which would, I imagine, be difficult to replace. I am not sure of their salary but, if it is what I see listed on Glassdoor, then it would seem that a salary review is something that management could look into.", "rating": 5, "pros": "The atmosphere on my floor is relaxed and friendly and almost all of the colleagues I have dealt with have been very welcoming and friendly too.

Junior employees will learn a great deal about software and in-house technologies, and will also develop skills in client/stakeholder relations. More senior employees will receive plenty of opportunities to develop their people management skills. Gorkana Group deals with a huge variety of clients and third-party service providers around the world, so employees are able to build their own networks of skilled and experienced people. Hard-working employees will be trusted to implement and run their own projects. More often than not, their direct managers will give them freedom and leeway to make their own mistakes, which allows them to learn and improve along the way. Not many organisations will allow this flexibility. As a result of this employees have the ability to vary their tasks and responsibilities, meaning the day-to-day job is less likely to become tedious. For the most part, rewards, recognition and career progression are based on meritocracy. Cons Gorkana Group essentially consists of three companies, which were amalgamated into one group on the back of merger & acquisition activity. Approximately five years later, there are still significant issues around proper integration. This is obviously a major challenge for any business, but there are some aspects which could/should have been handled better. From my personal experience, the main issue lies with the inconsistency between the company's main departments in numerous key areas: investment in systems and technology; consistency in transparency and communication; resource and workload management; salary and bonus structures. This manifests itself in different ways. It can be something as simple as a particular message being filtered down to one department, but not another. Or in more extreme examples, one department having a disproportionately imbalanced workload compared to others, yet not having in place an appropriate mechanism for recognising and rewarding employees. Advice to Management Continue flexible approach to career development. It is definitely succeeding in the areas in which it is being applied. Acknowledge and rectify major inconsistencies across departments. Or, at the very least, issue strong justification on why these inconsistencies need to be in place.

There is a worrying lack of appreciation for employees who are subject to an abundance of petty rules, financial penalties and unnecessary bureaucracy. Wages are low and turnover is high.

It is clear no one wants to be there and most are hanging around for the company to sell so they can collect their pay cheques.

These people usually lack the relevant managerial experience, are well paid and there are too many of them, so they bicker constantly and get nothing done. There is no respect between management and those producing revenue and a huge cultural difference between the three merged companies. Bonuses in media monitoring are paid according to how many pieces of coverage a client has generated in the press. This is rather rudimentary to say the least - how can you be paid a bonus on something completely out of your control? In addition, often there will be an internal change in ownership, meaning Gorkana doesn't lose the revenue, but the salesperson is penalised nonetheless. Targets are set by an random estimation of how much coverage will be generated over 12 months. If a client is working on a short project it doesn't count, despite Gorkana making money. Basically, they whole thing is extremely confusing and there is no audit trail so you can never find out what has happened and prove or disprove your bonus payments. In Analysis, pricing is so rigid that you cannot compete with the other providers in the sector. Prices are too high for monitoring and evaluation because everything is manual and so operational costs must be astronomical. Having 3 or 4 people check if something is relevant to a client (and for them to still get it wrong) is just crazy given the capability of modern technology.

But you're also guaranteed to work under multiple managers who are incompetent or uninterested. If despite initial disappointments and frustrations you keep giving it 100%, become a reliable worker, uphold quality and generally keep your clients and teammates happy, upper management will rarely show gratitude; you'll most likely be rewarded with a heavier workload. And don't expect this to coincide with a pay rise or promotion. These seem to be handed out in ways that are often arbitrary, illogical and lacking in transparency. Positive appraisals, client feedback or peer reviews do not appear to be worth anything. Of course, not all promotions are undeserved, but at anywhere from a third to half tend to be premature or unjustified. Similarly, many external hires, especially at middle-management or director level, have been ill-thought-out: people have been hired who have little interest or knowledge of the industry, poor people skills and no analytical capacity. If so much is wrong, you may ask, isn't upper management aware and trying to find remedies? Well, even though there is meant to be continuous dialogue between upper management and middle management and those below, and even though the operational, account and sales teams are meant to communicate and align themselves, it just doesn't seem to happen. Attempts to improve processes have consistently failed and employee input is not taken seriously-- which is really a shame, because it is a company in an interesting industry with some good tools in place, access to rich data and an impressive roster of clients.
