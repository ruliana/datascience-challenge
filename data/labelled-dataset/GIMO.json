Everything is a mess and no one really knows or can help you with your work. People work here without passion, they just make the system can work, so all the systems are messy, hard to maintain, and can be broken at anytime in future. 2. No flexible work hours, no work from home option. You need to work from 9am to 6pm, two 15 mins breaks at 11am and 4pm, lunch break at 1am, everyone should be the same, like prisoners. They even ask you to work, when you are sick and take a day off. 3. Low paid, minimum benefit. Only 20 annual holidays, and they used 3 days for Christmas, so you only have 17 days to use as you want actually. They pay you as less as possible. They paid me less for no reason after I said I want to quit. 4. Terrible management. When you have concern or question about your benefit and you ask HR, they don't reply you! You ask everyday, and they just ignore you or reply you useless response like 'I'm going to reply you later'. Managers sit in totally separated area and use a different door, like they are higher level of people and they can't be in the same place with us slaves. 5.

The management is so proud of the Pizza Friday and the Drink Friday it makes it pathetic! Cons - Low salary, no flexibility, 20 holidays, overtime not paid - The managers are a joke, all the directors (a bunch of clowns all related in a way or another) can barely express themselves in English. This goes also to some employees who were hired even if they cannot communicate properly in English. - The company policy is to hire people with little experience or no experience at all to pay them the minimum which can lead to big failures with people having roles they shouldn't have and cannot handle. - Time keeping is important. The break times and lunch times are in your contract but if this applies to most employees some seem to be exempt. - The directors have no shame. Even if your workload is busy they don't hesitate to send you some personal tasks to do that are not related to the company or the industry... Everybody acts as if it were normal, so be ready to do some personal favours or work for their relatives whenever they need your skills and can save money.... HR is aware of this situation but seems powerless or doesn't want to act on it. - All the positive reviews were posted on the same day, how bizarre??? but when you actually realise that they were asked by HR and some of the directors and posted by themselves, you understand how it went from a few negative reviews to a dozen of really good ones.... - Overall this is the worst company I have ever worked for, everything is done to the minimum so it is still legal but don't expect anything else. I wouldn't recommend this company but obviously it is not easy to find a job, so if you have to work there be mentally prepared to work for a bunch of a idiots, deal with the most ridiculous requests and deadlines, just use them as they use you, take the experience and leave as soon as you can. Advice to Management Respect your employees, they are not slaves or personal assistants.

Saying that to talk about the company, They expect u to come in and know everything like you've been working there for a years.. No one wants to help u when they give you the impossible amount of tasks to do everyday.. If you don't speak French or kiss bum then you might as well leave not sign up for a job because you'd probably get fired within a year. Half the time they don't even pay you on time!!!!

More seriously, there is one bonus, only one, given for Christmas, with usually targets impossible to reach, it depends if they like you or not. You will learn a lot in this company because roles are not well defined so you can work on various tasks or products. You will have to learn mostly by yourself though, they don\u2019t train anyone, even if they say so during your interview. Cons You will have to work hard and fast, very fast, usually for a lower than usual salary, so once again it\u2019s only good as a starting job, no more. If they offer you a very good salary, it means they just want to \u201cuse\u201d you for your knowledge, just for a couple months, usually 6 months to a year, before they fire you. It\u2019s fine if your English is not good, most of the employees are foreigners, it\u2019s how they get good people for cheaper. It seems that only good actors/mediocre workers get the best jobs there. I\u2019ve always been amazed to see how hard people work when they are poorly treated and paid. I have to say, if there is something the management is good at, it\u2019s manipulation. People get fired on a regular basis, I guess it\u2019s to accentuate the \u201cterror\u201d atmosphere of the office. Their method is also particularly elegant: typically they would inform people they are fired on a Friday at 5:50pm and tell them not to come back on Monday, and they can\u2019t even say goodbye. Work-wise the management don\u2019t know what they are doing and are totally unorganised. They change their mind about everything every week and they like impossible deadlines, they might find it fun!? Every couple of weeks they\u2019ll come up with a new \u201cgreat idea\u201d that is in reality pointless and everybody will have to work even harder to make these changes...before another stupid idea comes to their minds, they self-sabotage their company with this attitude. As you will see in other reviews they are very strict about time keeping, but not for everybody, it depends if they particularly like you or not. Oh and I have seen a couple of positive reviews about this company but don\u2019t be fooled, they wrote them, it\u2019s certain! It\u2019s typically the management\u2019s method...they are such a joke!

Many employees see this as a springboard to a career rather than a long term option.
