I lucked out and work for one of the better organizations within the company. G4S is willing to give you career advancement as along as you put forth the effort. You will get out of the job whatever you are willing to put into the job. Benefits- If your single the benefits are not that expensive.

I think G4S needs to pay you your normal site pay. Vacation time and sick time are all in one bank. Also vacation and sick time does not build.

This is regardless of your experience. If you have 10+ years experience and you start working with someone that has only 1 year of experience, you both make the same.
